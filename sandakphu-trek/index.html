  <h1>Sandakphu Trek</h1>

<p>Growing up I've always been interested in trekking; So, naturally when<br />
a friend suggested that we should go for a trek in 2018, I was kinda<br />
skeptical and kinda excited. Skeptical mainly because it was a<br />
significant amount of money including all the equipment I had to buy<br />
for a high altitude trek in the winter; and excited because it was a<br />
trek. My very first trek. I had a lot of expectations in my head.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Sandakphu-">Why Sandakphu ?<a class="headerlink" href="#Why-Sandakphu-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>My friend and me wanted to go for a different trek but we couldn't get<br />
the booking in time. So we choose Sandakphu. Apart from that Sandakphu<br />
was on our radar mainly because of the length of the trek and the good<br />
reviews. Both of us wanted to do something that was a challenging and<br />
lengthy so after Goechala; Sandakphu fit the bill perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="Preparation">Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#Preparation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The preparation of this trek involved two parts mainly. </p>
<p>Firstly, I had to prepare myself physically for the trek. I was not<br />
too worried about the physical part since I walk a lot on a regular<br />
basis and I also started running after moving to Mumbai.</p>
<p>However for this trek I needed to buy some rather expensive equipment.<br />
I needed to buy one rucksack, and some clothing for the low<br />
temperature and shoes. The clothing was most important. I did not want<br />
to buy something too expensive and too specialized for the trek. I<br />
wanted something more versatile.</p>
<p>Buying the rucksack was easy. I bought a 60L pack. I really wanted to<br />
buy a 70L but realized that it would be too much.</p>
<p>Buying the clothing was more fun! When you are selecting clothing for<br />
treks, you want to be as efficient as possible because everything you<br />
own, you have to carry it yourself. One of the techniques is to use<br />
layering. There are plenty of good websites online that talk about<br />
layering (fyi. the layering information on IndiaHikes site is shit and<br />
absolutely not reliable).</p>
<p>The layering can be quite complicated but ultimately it boils down to<br />
minimizing the loss of heat (clothes do not generate heat, instead<br />
they keep you warm by minimizing heat loss). So tl;dr I bought two<br />
polyester base layers and one hollow-fill jacket from decathlon. The<br />
hollow-fill jacket was good enough for heat but under certain extreme<br />
windy conditions I did find it a bit too cold as it is not completely<br />
wind-proof. But it was good enough for this trek.</p>
<p>For shoes I decided to rent a pair from IndiaHikes.</p>
<h2 id="The-Trek">The Trek<a class="headerlink" href="#The-Trek" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The trek was from 22<sup>nd</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup> of December. We picked this batch<br />
hoping that we would get extreme cold temperature.</p>
<p>On 22<sup>nd</sup> we met the rest of the team the NJP station in West Bengal and<br />
we started off to Jaubhari. Jaubhari is the IndiaHikes base camp for<br />
the Sandakphu trek.  At Jaubhari we were briefed about the trek by our<br />
trek leader. I was really surprised to know about the various<br />
activities that IndiaHikes does on the mountains to make the treks<br />
more sustainable. Someone from IndiaHikes also briefed the entire team<br />
about the benefits of using menstrual cups which I found really cool!<br />
After this out medical parameters were checked and recorded, followed<br />
by some dinner. Jaubhari is at 2134 meters.</p>
<p>At Jaubhari we also received our rented equipment. I rented a shoe but<br />
for some reason I could not feel comfortable in them. They felt<br />
different. So against the advise of the trek leaders and other fellow<br />
trekkers I decided to continue the trek in my regular shoes.</p>
<p>One 23<sup>rd</sup>, we reached Tumling which was at 2970 meters. The trek was<br />
fun. We stopped in the middle of the trek for lunch. At Tumling the<br />
temp was somewhere around 2-5 C.</p>
<p>On the way to Tumling the waist belt of the pack of a fellow trekker<br />
got ripped. At Tumling we managed to get hold of some needle and<br />
thread and stitched the ripped belt. It was a hacky job but the belt<br />
worked till the last day of the trek. Note to self: Carry needles and<br />
nylon thread.</p>
<p>One thing that was constant throughout the trek were the view of the<br />
Everest on the left and Kanchenjunga on the right. We could see them<br />
everyday, which is a welcome change from the normal stuff we are used<br />
to seeing everyday. :-P</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The weather was quite cold which was quite enjoyable for me. I went<br />
for a walk after dinner to experience the cold and also to test my<br />
jacket. I did remove my jacket for a bit and it got too cold too<br />
fast. The jacket was doing its job perfectly and I was satisfied with<br />
my purchase. :-P</p>
<p>On 24<sup>th</sup> we reached Kalipokhri which is at 3170 meters. I do not<br />
remember the details of this days trek. I do remember that at<br />
Kalipokhri all of us gathered in the hut where we were supposed to<br />
have dinner a all of us sang. It was a beautiful experience.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><img alt="Kanchenjunga" src="../assets/images/2019-02-24/kanchenjunga.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After dinner I headed out for another walk. I told three people that I<br />
would be going outside and where I would be going and gave them a<br />
tentative timeframe. There was a short hill nearby our lodge. I<br />
fancied walking up it in the morning but couldn't. So now was my<br />
time. It was exceptionally dark although the moon was<br />
present. thankfully my headlamp came handy. I was climbing the hill<br />
from the leeward side so I could not figure out the wind speed. On top<br />
it was another story. It was extremely windy. It was good. This was a<br />
good place.</p>
<p>On 25<sup>th</sup> we reached Sandakphu which was at 3577 meters. It was quite<br />
cold, but the views were amazing. </p>
<p>The trek to sandakphu was mostly thorough a motor-able road although<br />
there were certain shortcuts which were somewhat more technical than<br />
the road. Wile trekking we were also picking up small pieces of<br />
plastic. I managed to pick up a used sanitary napkin (who the fuck<br />
throws a sanitary napkin out there). Anyway, I also managed to<br />
annoy a co-trekker when I was being stupid and picked up a water<br />
bottle that was not in a safe position (sorry!!).</p>
<p>We had some time to kill in Sandakphu so we all got together and sang<br />
and played dumb charades. It was my turn and I froze completely<br />
(again!!). At this point I should just stop playing these games.</p>
<p>We also saw the milky-way. This was the first time I was seeing the<br />
Milky Way and it was amazing. :-)</p>
<p>On 26<sup>th</sup>, we left from Sandakphu and went to Sabargram located at 3600<br />
meters. This place was really cold. I helped pitch some toilet tents. </p>
<p>We also managed to do some amazing photography and got good shots of<br />
the milky-way.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On 27<sup>th</sup> we were supposed to reach Phalut which is at 3642 meters and<br />
then descend back to Gorkhey which is at 2300 meters. This day was too<br />
much fun. By the end of the trek I was running down the hill along<br />
with our guide Buddha Ji.</p>
<p>There is a river flowing through Gorkhey and some of us went there to<br />
dip our feet in the stream. I managed to slip and fall down into the<br />
river; thankfully I did not get too wet otherwise I would be in<br />
trouble. </p>
<p>Me and an equally crazy co-trekker decided to compete about who can<br />
keep their feet in the cold water for the longest time. I won that<br />
competition. The water wasn't that cold.</p>
<p>As this was the second last day of the trek we all gathers in the<br />
men's dorm and everyone shared small bits and pieces about what they<br />
would be taking away from the trek. This was another noteworthy<br />
experience.</p>
<p>28<sup>th</sup> marked the last day of the trek and quite possibly the last day<br />
some of us would ever see each other again. We started off early in<br />
the morning and we reached the final spot at Sepi well ahead of time. </p>
<p>We had lunch and then we took vehicles to Jaubhari (base camp) where<br />
we were supposed to return our rental equipment and pick up other<br />
stuff for the journey back home.</p>
<p>The journey to Jaubhari wasn't too special, except everyone was tired<br />
and I think everyone knew that the trek had already ended. It felt<br />
kinda sad to realize that there was a very good chance that none of us<br />
would see each other ever again.</p>
<p>The journey from Jaubhari to NJP was quite interesting. We had a train<br />
to catch so we were under the clock. On top of that the weather got<br />
significantly worse and it started snowing heavily. It was snowing so<br />
much that we couldn't see the road ahead, thankfully though, the<br />
driver of the jeep knew the route and he cold drive under those<br />
conditions. I puked on the way (Is it really trekking if you don't<br />
puke). We reached the railway station to find that the train was<br />
delayed. We all said our goodbyes and promised to stay in touch. </p>
<p>And that was it. My first trek had ended. :-)</p>

<h2 id="What-does-trekking-mean-for-me-">What does trekking mean for me ?<a class="headerlink" href="#What-does-trekking-mean-for-me-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I like being self-reliant. I get a lot of pleasure out of doing<br />
everything I need myself. It's about being able to solve my own<br />
problems myself and also understand how the world works in some tiny<br />
manner.</p>
<p>I also believe in owning less and living a simple, minimalist and<br />
sustainable life. People who know me, know that I have very little<br />
respect for the more common <em>needs</em> of life. The ultimate target would<br />
be to carve a life in which I do not own anything I do not need and<br />
quite possibly live out of a suitcase. :-P</p>
<p>I also enjoy solitude more than the average human being (or so I<br />
think). I also enjoy walking a lot. Walking helps me orient myself<br />
wiht my thoughts in some sort of way. Whenever I am having some<br />
(any!!) trouble, or I can not understand something I am studying or I<br />
start feeling lonely, I go for a walk. I enjoy the conversations I<br />
have with myself during these walks. I walk to unwind after a<br />
stressful day. I regularly walk home (roughly 6 kms) after a weird day<br />
at work.</p>
<p>Trekking is something that ties all of this together in some weird<br />
sort of way. It makes you realize what all you do not need. It helps<br />
you declutter.</p>
<p>There is something thrilling about carrying everything you <em>think</em><br />
you can need in a bag and walk into the wilderness. Now, the trek was<br />
not like "walking into the wilderness"; in-fact far from it actually,<br />
but I guess this is the beginning. I would actually love to trek in a<br />
completely un-supported fashion but right here, right now, its not<br />
feasible. Maybe someday. Right now, this is good enough. :-)</p>
<p>That's it. Thanks for reading. :-)</p>
