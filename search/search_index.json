I throw around the term \"DevOps\" and \"Software Engineer\" rather casually in my CV. Strictly speaking, I aim to be a generalist. I like networks, distributed-systems and complex-systems in general. The words are vague for a reason. I do not want to be specific. Being vague gives me a lot of space to explore.</p> <p>Personally, I enjoy learning things for the sake of learning things. I am a bit skewed towards STEM fields; with an even bigger skew towards Computers. I am trying to fix this skew.</p> <p>I find writing to be an excellent way of thinking. It really helps me think clearly. Hence, this site. This is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and to do it properly.</p> <p>This is not a blog. This is a live-record of things that I am doing. Nothing is static. Things will be updated regularly.</p> <p>I also enjoy walking, cycling, and treks. I often go on long lazy walks and take lots of photos of plants and other interesting things. I do a teeny-tiny bit of photography too. Sometimes, I visit crowded spaces and just observe people go about their usual lives.</p> <p>I enjoy my own company quite a lot and I read a fair bit.</p> <p>I enjoy the outdoors and I trek often.</p>"},{"location":"about/#Contact-","title":"Contact ...","text":"<p>I am extremely online.

The only thing that changes with the motorcycle is how many kilometres do I cover on a single day. </p> <p>On a bicycle a respectable and more important sustainable mileage is about 100kms per day.  On a bike, for me, that number is close to 400kms. (though I have never done 400kms) on a single day. My personal best is 360kms which happened when I took the bike to Mumbai and back to Pune on a single day.</p> <p>This is roughly how the route looked.</p> <ul> <li>Pune -&gt; Ganpatipule (via mahabaleshwar, Chiplun and Jaigad (308 kms)</li> <li>Ganpatipule -&gt; Tarkali (170kms)</li> <li>Tarkali -&gt; Palolem (182 kms)</li> <li>Palolem -&gt; Belgavi (147kms)</li> <li>Belgavi -&gt; Pune (350kms)</li> </ul> <p>Here is a link to Google Maps.

I kept the daily mileage to less than 200 kms on most days. I wanted to save some time and energy to do other stuff. Most of the evenings were packed with other activities.</p> <p>Mahabaleshwar was added to the itinerary of day-1 just 1 day before leaving. My colleague told me about strawberry and cream (a desert that is very famous in mahabaleshwar) and I could not refuse. Moreover, it added only about 20 extra kilometers to the total distance for day-1. It was ok.</p> <p>A friend recommended a scuba diving school in Tarkali and I jumped on the opportunity and decided to give it a shot. This needed pre-booking and the owner also helped me find a decent place to stay. It was great!</p> <p>I was supposed to go to Gokarna, but I was not able to find a hostel in time, hence I booked the first hostel that I could find using google-maps as I scanned upwards from Gokarna. As luck would have it, an old friend from school was also staying at Palolem during the exact dates and we hung out after more than 5 years. </p> <p>Belgavi was also fun, I decided to attend Science Hack Day.

It is a very small town. My friends suggested that I didn't need to fix my stay beforehand and I could just roll into the town and find a place to stay. My paranoid ass did not let me do this. I instead found a cheap hotel for the night on MakeMyTrip. With the destination set, I had one thing less to worry about.</p> <p>At about 6am in the morning, I loaded up the bag, put on my jacket and started.  To go Mahabaleshwar, you take the Pune-Bangalore highway and then exit from the highway just before Satara. The highway was nice and boring. I always find highways to be extremely boring.</p> <p>Things became interesting once we got off the highway. We moved to a double-track road from a 6 lane protected highway. The speed reduced considerably. Soon the ghats began. This part of the trip was amazing. The rolling ghats of Mahabaleshwar was amazing.</p> <p>What really surprised me was the abundance of strawberry and strawberry related imagery. I saw shops, cars, houses etc decorated with pictures and models of strawberries. I also saw strawberries being sold on the road-side in bulk. Till this moment, i had seen strawberries being sold in boxes-of-6 at the local market. I however, co'uld not buy some because I was travelling.</p> <p>On arriving at the \"Mapro Garden\" I took a much needed break and had the \"Strawberry with Cream\". It was amazing. Probably one of the best strawberries I've ever had. I never knew that strawberries could be so sweet!!! I used the facilities and left this place soon enough. The other half of the trip was still remaining for the day.</p> <p> Here is a photo of the desert and coffee. (The coffee was bad)</p> <p>I left soon after, as it was getting late. What followed was some of the best ghat section I've ever come across. I stopped and took a LOT of pictures. This is where most of my time was spent.</p> <p> The photo does not do justice.</p> <p>During the dry season, you can see the layers of rocks on the Deccan plateau. It looks like a multi-layered cake.</p> <p> LOOK at those layerssss!!!!</p> <p>After exiting the ghats, I decided to head to Chiplun instead of Dapoli as planned as going to Dapoli would take some time and I did not want to ride in the dark. I was feeling quite tired already. After Chiplun, I took a left and kept going towards Guhagar, and then took a left towards Jaigad. These roads were very small and they followed the contour of the hill very closely. Riding in these roads was very engaging, requiring a lot of clutch and gear adjustments. I was enjoying this thoroughly.  The sea was very close. You could smell it. This particular smell would be constant companion for the rest of the trip.</p> <p>There were sections in which the road had to cross a river that was emptying into the Arabian sea. To do this, the road would descend steeply to the sea-level where we would find a small bridge. Once you cross that bridge, the road would rise again. This happened some \u2154 times throughout the entire trip. During these \"dips\" (as I like to call them), I passed through multiple small fishing villages. I have a photo of one such village during a low-tide. It looks rather interesting.</p> <p></p> <p>In Jaigad we had a Ferry ride. I was looking forward to this part of the trip very much. I arrived just in time. The ticket cost me about 100 rupees for both myself and the bike. I met three other people on their motorcycles too. They were going to Goa as well. However, they were too experienced and too fast for me. So I decided not to follow them.</p> <p> This group was fun. We chatted a bit. That is my shadow taking the pic.</p> <p>On the other side of the ferry, things became very very interesting. Now, the road didn't climb onto the hill, instead it continued lazily along the sea. This geographic feature led to some amazing views. There was a point, where the hill on the left and the sea on the right were separated only by the road.  Like you could walk from the sea onto the hill in less than a kilometre. This blew me away. I stopped the bike and kept looking at this for some time. It was lovely.</p> <p> What did I tell you :-) ?</p> <p>The lodge was decent-enough. You can not and should not expect anything better at this price point. All I needed was a place to keep the bike and a place to sleep and shower. Fortunately the owners were quite cool about the bike. They had a decent parking facility. They were also kind enough to provide me with some hot water for the next day's early morning coffee. After checking-in I went to the beach and spent a couple hours there. </p> <p>Being a temple-town, there is a lot of \"pure-vegetarian\" food places. However being a coastal town, fish is a major part of thir diet. It was interesting to observe this dynamic. Most restaurants had 2 versions of itself, often seperated by a floor or some walls etc. One part would be completely vegetarian and the other part was completely non-veg. I had a fish-thali here. It was fresh and expensive and delicious.</p> <p></p> <p>That day I retired early and went to bed. The next day I started at around 8 am. The distance was less, but I also had a serious deadline. I had to reach the scuba place before 1 p.m. if I wanted to experience the larger tour.</p>","tags":["motorcycle","travel"]},{"location":"konkan-bike-tour-2022/#Day-2-Ganpatipule-to-Tarkali--Dec-21-2022-","title":"Day 2: Ganpatipule to Tarkali [ Dec 21, 2022 ]","text":"<p>The ride was very easy this day. We drove through some narrow roads and passed a lot of bridges and fishing villages. We reached Tarkali in about 5 hours and checked-in to the stay.</p> <p>The stay was at this lovely establishment run by this person since 2002. We spent some time chatting. He said he started with a single room to rent out and then slowly grew the property to about 14 rooms in the span of 18 years. He was strictly against loans from banks and instead relied on savings to fund his growth; he boasted that this is how he survived through covid, where tourism was at an all-time-low. He proudly  mentioned that his wife was his main support during these years and that without her support, he would not have been able to expand his business. The boasted that he was planning to build a swimming pool next. I was the only visitor to this property during this time, so we had a lot of time to chat.</p> <p>The property was adjacent to his house in-fact they shared the same compound and kitchen. The visitors were treated to the same food that the family prepared for themselves. So when he asked if I wanted to have dinner that night, I did not refuse.</p> <p> This is just a part of the whole stay. There are room adjacent to the building in the photo.</p> <p>After checking-in, I cleaned up a bit and went to the scuba thing. Since I had a decent amount of time before sundown, I decided that I wanted to have the longest possible tour.</p> <p>The setup was such; we were given wet-suits and put on a boat. The boat would then take us to a spot where we would do some basic training. After that we would do a couple dives in different parts of the sea.</p> <p>We started with some snorkelling exercises so that we can familiarise ourselves with the mechanics of breathing with a mask on. It took some time to get used to this, but afterwards, it was very easy. After this, we were given a very short training of some hand-signals and how to use the breathing apparatus underwater. Everything was supervised as the instructor would always be there with you.</p> <p>We did a couple of dives near the Sindhudurg fort. The corals that we saw were all dead.  What surprised me was that the entire activity was purely focused on photography. The instructors had an underwater camera and food for the fishes. They would prepare a shot and then use the food to bait the fish into the frame. This is how most of the pictures with the fishes were taken. There was a couple with me on the boat and they even had a couple's photo-shoot package. They made the couple pose cutely underwater and took photos and videos of it. This lasted for about 3 hours where we went to different parts of the sea using the boat and spent anywhere from 30 mins to 45 mins underwater. </p> <p>After all this was over, the photographs were promptly transferred to our mobile phones using a USB pen-drive. After this, we were dropped back on the sea beach and we could do whatever we wanted to do.</p> <p>I spent some more time walking on the beach and picking up dead blowfish that the sea bestowed upon the shore.</p> <p> There were a LOT of dead fishes. Not sure why.</p> <p>Slowly, I watched the setting sun against the backdrop of the Sindhudurg fort. It was magical. I waited a while longer for darkness to settle in. </p> <p></p> <p>Back at the stay I was treated to the best Konkan thali I've ever tasted. The food was tasty and delicious. They also gave me one extra Bangda (Indian Mackerel) and he would not accept payment for it. The solkadhi I had was also amazing. Apparently his wife's family had a secret recipe passed down the generations for this solkadhi.</p> <p> That white thing in the small bowl is the Solkadhi. It is not as red in color, but It was supremely flavorful.</p> <p>After diner I spent some time cleaning and lubing the bike chain.

Most parts of this leg of the journey has very very isolated sections of road and unlike the other parts of the journey, the roads were is very bad shape.

The road at this stretch was almost non-existent and broken, it wasn't dirt, it was just loose rocks. The bike was running in 2<sup>nd</sup> gear throughout. </p> <p>After this section, I did pass through some bridges overlooking some beautiful fishing villages.

I don't remember exactly where, but I got onto NH-66 somewhere between here and reaching Palolem. NH-66 was boring, but it was quite a bit of relief. The road conditions were so bad that I did not stop to take photos. After getting on the highway, there was no spot to take photos from. Almost all highways are the same concrete jungles.</p> <p>Riding in Goa was fun. The roads were beautiful and so was the city. Most of the roads were covered with large trees which was a great sight.</p> <p>Upon reaching Palolem, I had my first small mishap on this trip. I was reversing the bike and ended up putting the rear wheel into a ditch. One thing led to another and I found a metal part of the bike stuck onto my left calf. Through it didnt injure me too much, it did draw blood. I cleaned the wound after a couple local helped me get the bike out of the ditch. Fortunately the hostel and my stay for the next two days was just nearby. I parked the bike and cleaned up. </p> <p>I had originally planned to stay for 1 night in Goa, but extended it because me and the friend made some plans for the next day. We spent the entire day drinking and hanging out. We also spent a lot of time just sitting on the beach. This was very different from what I am used to. Initially the idle-ness of it made me very uneasy. I have to keep doing something. However, I got used to it quite soon and relaxing felt nice. This is of-course very different from my usual travelling where I fill every minute with something to do (even walking). We just sat there and witness the setting sun.

I was back in action.</p> <p>I drank a lot of water and washed my face with some of it. Then some of the locals urged me to take the bike to a garage and get the bike checked out. I complied. The mechanic at the garage told me that the bike was OK and in perfect drive-able condition. So, I decided that the best course of action for me was to head to the largest town nearby (which was Kolhapur) and to stay there for a day and to get myself checked out at a doctors.</p> <p>Kolhapur was 60kms in the other direction. So off I went. Halfway on my way to Kolhapur I realised that I didn't know where the accident occurred and more importantly, i did not have pictures of the accident site.

This is a place called Yuksom. Yuksom used to be the first capital of Sikkim. The ride from HMI to Yuksom was easy. We were given motion sickness tablets which really helped. The roads were okay for the most part, though some sections in the middle were absolutely terrible. It was a pleasant ride overall.</p> <p>Our car was the last one to arrive and by then other teams had already started pitching their tents. We followed suit and soon, we had a 6 person tent for ourselves. Pitching the tent was a challenge because none of the tents had any pegs. We ended up pulling stones from random places and typing the guy-lines to these stones. Things were really stable once we were done.</p> <p></p> <p>After lunch we went for a short walk to a local shrine called Norbugang Chorten. It is said that the first monarch of Sikkim was crowned here. The name Yuksom comes from this event too. Yuksom literally means meeting place of the three learned monks. These monks came together and selected Phuntsog Namgyal as the first Chogyal (or Religious King) of Sikkim.</p> <p>There was a shop near our camp grounds which was serving fancy-food; i.e. things like momos and packed goods. Some of us picked up rations for the climb. I didn't bother. I wanted this experience to be as raw as possible.

We clocked in a respectable 16 km and gained about 1200 m in elevation.  The trail was actually very prominent and we did not have any trouble finding our way. This trail is a very common hiking route which leads to the famous Goecha-La trek. The route till Dzongri is the same; after which we go into the Rathong Valley.</p> <p>We had hot breakfast at the camp and we carried dry food for our lunch. Today we would be crossing four bridges on our way and we were told in no uncertain terms that there is a very steep incline just after the fourth bridge and that the fourth bridge would be the last rest point for us. This is where we would stop to have lunch. </p> <p>As today was the first hike of the course, we soon figured out the dynamics. The entire batch soon split into groups. There was a forward party which comprised of the fastest and the strongest trekkers. They would cover some distance and then stop and wait for the rest of the team to catch up The instructors tried to make sure that the gap between the first group and the last group wasn't too large, but we soon discovered that the last group was so far behind that it made no sense to keep the entire batch waiting. Often this gap was about 2 hours. </p> <p>I was very worried about my knee. I even started using my trekking-poles. However I found that my knees behaved admirably and I was able to complete the trek with the first group itself. I was very proud of myself. </p> <p>The camp at Tshoka was a mixed camp. Some of us were allotted rooms in the wooden house while some were allotted camping spots and they had to pitch tents. </p> <p>Surprisingly, we had slightly unstable mobile network at this campsite. The weather was cloudy and it started raining too. I was worried. </p> <p>After this, we headed for a short acclimatization walk. There was noting short about this. We walked for about 3 km. As it was raining, we wore the rain-gear. I also made the mistake of wearing my feather-jacket underneath the rain gear. This was a major mistake as I would soon discover. </p> <p>The weather was cold and it was raining, but hiking in the feather jacket would mean that I was extremely sweaty. Thus the entire feather jacket was wet by the time we reached the end of the acclimatization walk. This was a fairly flat place on the trail. We had a class on the local flora and fauna that this point. The rain had stopped by this time and we were glad to be able to take off our rain-gear. This was a relief and it allowed for much needed ventilation.</p> <p>We stayed the night at Tshoka. Some of us went to the only cafe here and we treated ourselves to a hot bowl of Wai-Wai (a variety of instant noodles that is very common here).</p> <p>The next day we had more classes and stuff. Nothing spectacularly interesting about this day. </p> <p>Here is a photo looking up towards the cafe at Tshoka.</p> <p></p> <p>We were due to leave to Dzongri the next day.

The trail climbs as soon as we start. In some places the trail is paved with wooden logs. We find snow on the trail almost immediately. We were expecting snow and this was indeed fun.  We were walking through a forest at this point. It was quite dense and the Rhododendrons were blooming. The trail is quite steep until we reach Phedang. Here is a wooden hut and sometimes we can get tea/momos here. </p> <p>We find ourselves above the tree line at the point. The big trees that were towering over us gradually started reducing in their height. By the time we reach Dhongri they were barely 1 feet taller than us. After Phedang the trail eases out and we find ourselves traversing across the mountain. After the final turn we can see the Dzongri trekkers hut from a distance. It is a welcome sight. </p> <p>Here is a photo from a different angle. </p> <p>At Dzongri we are again camping for 2 days. We proceed to pitch our tent. As usual, the pegs are missing, we decide to tie our tent with another tent. Space was limited and so were big stones; hence this was the best thing to do here. Dzongri was very cold. To our dismay, we discovered that the tent had a damaged zipper which meant that one side of the tent would be open throughout the night. We strategically places our bags and gear along this side to guard against wind.</p> <p>After lunch we walked up to Dzongri Top  for our acclimatization climb. The entire route took us about 3 hours and we spent sometime at the top. I did not record this route, but from memory I think it was this route</p> <p>I remember the route being not so steep and a lot of contouring across the hills. Anyway the specifics do not really matter I guess.</p> <p>After this we descended down and had the rest of the day free. A bunch of us settled in the house of a couple who live there and run a small shop. The shop has everything, from chocolates to woolen socks. Everything is marked up here due to the logistical challenges. We also found delicious momos here and a room with a Bukhari which was a hit amongst the trainees. I found myself blowing into the Bukhari using a metal rod to kindle the fire. This was my first time doing this, so I was guided by a friend. It was an incredible experience, to watch the fire turn wood into dust. </p> <p>The night was interesting. It started snowing soon after dinner and it didn't stop for a while. It was very windy and snowy. We woke up the middle of the night with the entire tent shaking because of the wind. The tent was not properly pitched and we worried that it would collapse. Thankfully, the night passed without any incident. The next morning we were surprised by the condition of our tents. Almost every tent was in bad shape. It had snowed significantly during the night and that caused the tents to sag a LOT. We tried our very best to clear the snow and it worked for a while.  The lack of pegs meant that every tent was attached to rocks and some of these attachments were not too strong, which made things worse.</p> <p></p> <p>Today we were going for a walk to Lakshmi Pokhri. Again I did not record this, but based on photographs and memory this is the route. Honestly, I have no idea if this is Laxmi Pokhri or not as OSM says different things. If this lake is indeed Laxmi Pokhri, then we must update the maps. I will wait for more confirmation before I do that. Anyway, we must move on. The hike to the lake was fun, there was enough snow, mist and wind to make the hike very interesting. After we reached the lake, we walked around the lake once as a ritual. After that the entire batch got together to click a picture. We also got some snowfall on the way back.</p> <p>Here is the picture. </p> <p>Here is a photo where you can see the batch walking around the lake. </p> <p>After this we promptly started out walk back to the camp for the day. We were in for a rude surprise.  Once we returned, we discovered that wind had wreaked havoc on the campsite. Two of the tents that were tied to each other completely collapsed. Lunch was served and we rushed to eat lunch as the snow was starting to get worse. The snowfall intensified as we finished lunch. Now we had to salvage the tents.</p> <p>At this point, the tents lay collapsed in the snow for about an hour. When we went to recover the tents, we discovered that the aluminum poles had frozen and were jammed with each other. This made it impossible to take apart the tent or to pitch them properly. We requested the instructors to let us sleep in the wooden shelter. It was already occupied by 6 instructors, so fitting an extra 12 people would be slightly hard. But they agreed and soon all of us took part is transporting our gear from the tents to the hut in the middle of heavy snowfall. Once we were done, we tried to take apart the tents and packed them up. Some of tent-poles were left as it is because we could not dismantle them due to the cold weather. Anyway, once this ordeal was over, it was almost dinner time. We had one more hurdle before this.</p> <p>We were supposed to clear out Blood Pressure tests. Sadly this would result 4 of our friends being turned back from Dzongri because they could not clear this test. Additionally two young friends were quite sick and decided to turn back on their own accord. </p> <p>That night in that hut with more than 15 people inside, one person who shall me named patient zero gave us the cough that he was carrying from the city. After this I was sick throughout the course until the end. </p> <p>This was the second day of our stay at Dzongri.

The warm drink really helped warm you up just before getting inside the sleeping bag.</p> <p>The sleeping situation was not as bad as I had hoped it would be. We were separated from the wooden floor by a centimeter thick piece of foam which we had carried.

Primary reason is that I can download the maps offline and I can contribute data back into the OSM community.</p> <p>Also, the fact that most other apps / sites in this list rely on OSM data is an added bonus.

Fortunately GraphHopper exists. This is a series of OpenSource routing tools and they have a website that does routing beautifully. You basically get to create a route from point A to B and download the GPX. This is incredibly powerful especially if you are hiking / cycling and you need information regarding the terrain etc.</p>","tags":["maps","gpx","hiking","travel"]},{"location":"maptools/#Waymarked-Trails-Hiking","title":"Waymarked Trails: Hiking","text":"<p>This is the primary source of publicly available gpx traces. When I am trying to plan a hike / traverse, the first thing I do is to visit this site and look at all the existing traces. </p> <p>Of course there is no rule that says that you need to complete a trail end-to-end. So you can mix and match two trails that are in the same spot. Maybe find a new route / join two trails etc etc.</p> <p>This is extremely helpful if you are unsure about venturing into virgin territory.</p> <p>This is the hiking section of the website. There are also cycling / snow-sport sections etc etc.</p> <p>I admit that the website is not the best in the world and it needs some getting used to. :p</p>","tags":["maps","gpx","hiking","travel"]},{"location":"maptools/#GPS-Visualizer","title":"GPS Visualizer","text":"<p>There are a LOT of use-cases for this website, most of which I am unfamiliar with. However the biggest feature that I use a LOT is the <code>add-elevation</code> data feature. The website uses NASA DEM data and can add elevation data to any GPX file. Check it here.</p> <p>Most of the time, when you export GPX from a shitty app (Strava), they strip the elevation data. GPS Visualizer can fix that. </p> <p>The website is also useful if you want to convert from one format to another (KML/KMZ etc etc)</p>","tags":["maps","gpx","hiking","travel"]},{"location":"maptools/#Google-My-Maps","title":"Google My-Maps","text":"<p>You get to create your own maps using the data available at Google-Maps. The very basic-est usage is that you can upload GPX traces to this and overlay that on top of google-maps. This is very useful if you travel via car / motorcycle and you stick to roads which is where Google-Maps shines the most. The moment you are on-trail, Google Maps is not useful.</p> <p>Here is a link to the map I created for the KonkanBikeTour2022.</p>","tags":["maps","gpx","hiking","travel"]},{"location":"maptools/#Google-Earth","title":"Google Earth","text":"<p>There are 2 very special uses for these. Firstly you can use Google-Earth to visualize a route in 3D. Once you have a GPX trace, you can upload it here and explore the route.</p> <p>Secondly, if you are exploring unmapped places, sometimes you can see human trails on the map in Satellite-view mode. This is because in the higher altitudes due to lack of tree cover, you get to see trails that are carved by the locals of the region in the satellite view mode.</p> <p>I mostly use this for fun / visualization.</p>","tags":["maps","gpx","hiking","travel"]},{"location":"maptools/#Tools-that-I-am-learning-now","title":"Tools that I am learning now","text":"<ul> <li> <p>QGiS: I have always been interested in this and I feel this break is the perfect time to get started.
