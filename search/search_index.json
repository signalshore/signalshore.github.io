I throw around the term \"DevOps\" and \"Software Engineer\" rather casually in my CV. Strictly speaking, I aim to be a generalist. I like networks, distributed-systems and complex-systems in general. The words are vague for a reason. I do not want to be specific. Being vague gives me a lot of space to explore.</p> <p>Personally, I enjoy learning things for the sake of learning things. I am a bit skewed towards STEM fields; with an even bigger skew towards Computers. I am trying to fix this skew.</p> <p>I find writing to be an excellent way of thinking. It really helps me think clearly. Hence, this site. This is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and to do it properly.</p> <p>This is not a blog. This is a live-record of things that I am doing. Nothing is static. Things will be updated regularly.</p> <p>I also enjoy walking, cycling, and treks.

Reason is the main keyword here. It is reason that ultimately led to all beautiful inventions and achievements. Since the early days humanity has always strived to find the reasons that could describe the naturally occurring phenomenon around them.</p> <p>Man was (still is to some extent) a very inquisitive animal. If it were up to man then he would have had proper reasons for all the things that he could have had reasons for and he strived to achieve just that. Reasons that described everything man could think of. He strived for perfection. This led to a problem. Man did not realize that some (read: most) answers are not ultimate. They all lead to further questions that need further answers and the cycle repeats all over again. Soon enough humanity had more questions than it had answers for.</p> <p>This created a feeling of helpless-ness. Man could not stomach the fact that he did not have all the answers. Man could not stomach the fact that he was not in control. Man could not acknowledge the universe. Man felt helpless and insignificant (as he rightly is). Man was (still is) a bit too arrogant. A bit too arrogant for his own good. Man was/is a bit too fragile to accept the responsibility for all of his actions. He needs a scapegoat; not only to blame someone in case anything goes wrong but also someone to take the credit in case something goes right. This way man can escape accountability for his actions and blame god for the good and the bad. He needs to believe in something far bigger, far greater than himself to make him feel a part of something bigger than himself, to define a sense of purpose for him.</p> <p>THIS led to the invention of god.

This would increase the chances of getting most of our data back.</p> <p>Then we downloaded PhotoRec ( in Arch it is packaged with the TestDisk package ). We started PhotoRec form the terminal and followed the steps to select the partition we wanted to recover and also we had to select the partition where the recovered files would be stored. It is recommended that the partition where you store the recovered files and the partition that you want to recover data from be different partitions as this would reduce the chances of the old data being overwritten. </p> <p>Now after this you might see something like this. .</p> <p>This is normal and its perfectly fine to go about doing other stuff that you have to do while PhotoRec \"walks\" through the file-system and recovers files for you. </p> <p>One thing we should remember is that the recovery part is not such a pain! PhotoRec is amazing and does an amazing job. The main pain is actually picking up the files that YOU want from he whole bunch of recovered files. This is because since PhotoRec does not have any method to determine if the deleted files were deleted accidentally or not, it recovers everything that was deleted and not overwritten. Thus we have a LOT of work to do. </p>","tags":["cs","linux"]},{"location":"experience-with-data-recovery/#After-the-recovery","title":"After the recovery","text":"<p>These are some of the things that PhotoRec does after recovering the files. * Stores everything under multiple <code>recup_dir.&lt;integer&gt;</code> directories. It looks something like this  * Every file other than text files are properly named. As in other than text files all other files have their proper extensions. Thus PhotoRec doesn't mix up JPEG and PNG files. * That being said it does mix up text files. As in recovered Java files would sometimes be named as C++ header files and so on. * PhotoRec also recovers ELF files which are nothing but executable files.</p> <p> How do we go about sorting this mess ? Our first idea was to launch ranger and inspect every single directory and delete directories if the contents didn't feel too important. Something like this.  But there was a major flaw with this system. There were a lot of files in those directories and going through each one of them would be a tedious and a very very stupid thing to do. </p> <p>So we started making a list of the things that we lost and the things that we wanted to recovered from the mess. We figured that if we could not remember something that we had lost them we probably did not need it in the first place. Thus we figured that the most important stuff in the data directory ware the scripts that we had written for our Arch System. We also realized that we mostly needed text files from this partition recovery so we could delete all the non-text files and thus we started this massive assault on all non essential files. </p> <p>Initially we were writing scripts like </p> <pre><code>$ for file in (find ./ -name \"*.jar\"); rm -vf $file; end;\n</code></pre> <p>which worked like a charm. </p> <p>Then we figured out the better version of this command i.e.</p> <pre><code>$ find ./ -name \"*.jar\" -delete\n</code></pre> <p>which does the same thing; finds files with a particular extension (JAR files in this case) and delete them.</p> <p>We kept doing this for a huge set of files unless we were left with only text files.</p> <p>Now we needed to get all the DOCX files so we did this</p> <pre><code>$ for file in (find ./ -name \"*.docx\"); cp -c $file ../store; end;\n</code></pre> <p>Now comes the interesting part. Remember those scripts that we wrote.

I think I am lucky than most people because I got to work with technology that I love and I got to do things that I love as well (I have a small crush on teaching; mostly because I have had bad teachers and think we need to fix that!!) and on top of that; my job required me to learn more and more about Linux and to push the boundary.

On top of that learning something new takes a considerable amount of mental energy and time.</p> <p>That being said I do not find any difficulty in learning something absolutely new (this is only the case if I am learning something that I want to learn); but what surprised me was that even though the teachers I worked with were very dedicated to the cause but still they had difficulty getting used to the learning mentality. This used to bother me at times initially but then I had a breakthrough.</p> <p>I am 20 years old now and I would say that I am pretty lucky since I have a lot less things to worry about than most people. But the people I worked with are not so lucky. What I was not accounting for is the fact that they are not as free as I am. I was judging them based from a very narrow perspective and not accounting for the fact that they were more than just people with a job. They have families to take care of of, jobs to worry about and hundreds of other things that need their immediate attention.  So expecting that they would be \"perfect learners\" was an unwise thing to do. Thus even though the team was a very motivated team; they have every right to feel unmotivated from time to time.</p> <p>I always had a personal grudge against teachers mostly because I had seen teachers who were not too up to date with the current material and teachers who did not inspire curiosity and teachers who would rather say the wrong thing than accept that they do not know something. I always thought that managers were evil mostly because how my friends (who were working) always complained about how their managers were not good and did not know enough about the underlying system and stuff (I am generalizing here a bit).</p> <p>Enter the APF team</p> <p>The group I worked with included three high school teachers and a Project Manager. The most striking thing about them is their open-ness to new experience and their humility. This is a bunch of people who are in their 40s; who are very good at what they do (being teachers) and who are actively learning new technology that would enhance  the quality of education for high school students. Let that sink in for a moment.</p> <p>We had one person there who not only used GNU/Linux so that she could create localized materials for her students (in Kannada); she was also an active contributor the the GeoGebra community. This is the best manifestation of the FOSS movement. I have been associated with FSMK for over a year and this is the first time got to experience the real power of FOSS for someone outside the developer community. I always failed to grasp the idea that FOSS is about the people and not the technology completely until this experience. After this realized the full depth of the idea (I think so). There is also another person who was teaching himself woodworking, calculus and German just because he wanted to learn them.</p> <p>I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science and that requires some decent amount of mathematics which is not covered in great detail in my course. So I planned to take an online course and teach myself the maths. BUT I never did, I was too scared of finding out that I was too dumb or too stupid or too late to the party. In the course of these 6 months my interaction with these amazing people inspired me to enroll  in 4 MOOC while the usual FSMK work and APF work and College course work (more about this later). I realized that its better to start than to just wait for the correct time. It is tough to maintain all of these at the same time (I think I am in-eligible for some of the MOOC certificates right now; but the certificates are not why I started taking the MOOC in the first place :-) )</p>","tags":["linux","misc","work"]},{"location":"first-job-at-azim-premji-foundation/#Life-skills","title":"Life-skills","text":"<p>Let's talk about humility and open-ness.

This is also how the scheme syntax looks.

The name of the procedure is \"sum\" and it takes in two numbers and produces their sum.</p> <p>Let us write something a bit complicated</p> <p></p> <p>This procedure uses the previous \"sum\" procedure to compute the sum of the square of two numbers.

We could have no used it and it wouldn't have mattered too much. </p> <p>NOW!! here is the kicker! :-P</p> <p>Imagine for a second that you did not know how addition, multiplication, division etc worked. You could still define the procedure \"sumOfSquares\" knowing that you have procedures called \"sum\" and \"square\" that will take care of the internal operations for you.</p> <p>What this enables you to do is do a top down design approach to things.  While designing apps (nothing too big) in C++ I found myself being too worried about what were all the small parts the should make up the program, But after starting to read this book apart from learning scheme I also learned this model of thinking.</p> <p>The writers call this \"wishful thinking\"; as in you wish that something existed and then used it as if it existed. Then you tried to figure out if it did exist in the first place or not. If it does exist then fine; otherwise you design one.</p> <p>Which means that if at any point while designing a software you are un-sure about all sub-modules that will be required to make that module work then you do not start designing the sub-modules and build up from there. Instead you design the current module and then design the sub-modules to match the requirement set up by the module. This is top-down design approach.</p> <p>For example when designing \"sumOfSquares\" you need not think about how you will implement it. You can just write the code and then you can sit down and figure out how \"sum\" and \"square\" would work. At the time of writing the sumOfSquare you do not know if sum and square exist. You just use them as if they did existed.</p> <p>This also means that while wiring the sumOfSquare procedure you need not bother about how sum and square will be implemented.

This is interesting because this is directly related to the kind of computing model this language is based on. Lisp is based on a model of computing called Lambda Calculus. It was invented by Alonzo Church.</p> <p>On the other hand procedural and object oriented languages are based on a model of computing called the Turing Machine. In these languages there is some structure that lets us differentiate between what is code and what is data, but that is not the case in Lisp. Infact in Lisp code is treated as data in the form of higher order procedures.</p> <p>Lisp programs are trees. In other words the lists can be represented as tree such that - Every list within a pair of ( ) is treat as a node in the tree - The very first element of every list is the first child of that node   in the tree.

The if-construct in LISP looks like this.</p> <p><code>(if (expression) (expression1) (expression2))</code></p> <p>Now the if macro is special because it does not follow the normal evaluation strategy i.e. all the three expressions expression, expression1 and expression2 are not evaluated before the procedure is applied. In this macro only the first expression (expression) is evaluated first and if it evaluates to be true (#t) then expression1 will be evaluated. Otherwise expression2 will be evaluated.</p> <pre><code>(define (recursive x)\n    (if (= x 0)\n        0\n        (recursive (- x 1))))\n\n(recursive x 1)\n</code></pre> <p>What happens when we evaluate the last expression ? Nothing spectacular. We just get the value <code>0</code> which is what it is supposed to do. We get this answer only because LISP uses normal order evaluation (lazy evaluation) for the if construct. If like the default strategy it used applicative order evaluation then both the <code>0</code> and the <code>(recursive (- x 1))</code> would be evaluated before calling the procedure and that would lead to an infinite loop. But the if-constructs uses Normal order evaluation or non-strict evaluation.</p> <p>My next program will illustrate this. For that we will define a <code>new-if</code> procedure that will do exactly what <code>if</code> does.</p> <pre><code>(define (new-if predicate exp1 exp2) \n    (cond (predicate exp1)\n        (else exp2)))\n</code></pre> <p>This is the new-if procedure. Let us use this in our previous program.</p> <pre><code>(define (recursive-new x)\n    (new-if (= x 0)\n        0\n        (recursive-new (- x 1))))\n\n(recursive-new x 1)\n</code></pre> <p>What happens now ? </p> <p>NOW the thing goes into a spectacular infinite loop. That is because the new-if procedure will be evaluated using the applicative order strategy. Thus all the operands will be evaluated before the new-if procedure is called; and recursive-new has a call to itself. So in the end it all splatters exceptionally well.</p> <p>P.S.

If you think about it, in both the previous examples we are computing the sum of different terms. If we can capture the idea of <code>summing</code> in a procedure then that would give us the required abstraction. Mathematicians have done this using the \\(\\Sigma\\) notation. The Sigma notation captures the idea of the summation without knowing what we are summing. Thus the above two expressions can be rewritten as :</p> \\[ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + \\infty \\] <p>and </p> \\[ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + \\infty \\] <p>This lets us capture the idea of summation in the Sigma notation like </p> \\[ \\sum_{n=a}^b f(n) = f(a) + \\dots + f(b) \\] <p>and we can use that idea to write a procedure; like so..</p> <pre><code>(define (sum term a next b)\n    (if (&gt; a b)\n        0\n        (+ (term a)\n            (sum term (next a) next b)))) ;; (next a) updates the a\n</code></pre> <p>In the above procedure \"term\" and \"next\" are procedures too.  Term is a procedure that computes the value of each term. This procedure is the Lisp equivalent of the function \\(f(x)\\) in the mathematical Sigma notation. Next is a procedure that determines how the function will iterate.</p> <p>Thus for \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + \\infty\\) the Lisp procedure would be</p> <pre><code>(define (cube x) (* x x x))\n\n(define (next x) (+ x 1))\n\n(define (sum-cube a b)\n    (sum cube a next b)) ;; sum is defined above\n</code></pre> <p>This is not the end. We can use this idea to create multiple such abstractions. </p> <p>For example the multiplication procedure \\(\\coprod_{n=a}^b f(n) = f(a) * \\dots * f(b)\\) can be coded like</p> <pre><code>(define (product term a next b)\n    (if (&gt; a b)\n        1\n        (+ (term a)\n           (product term (next a) next b))))\n</code></pre> <p>We can use the multiplication abstraction to calculate factorials.</p> <pre><code>(define (factorial x)\n    (product identity 1 next x)) ;;defined above\n\n(factorial 5)                  ;; prints 120\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can see another uncanny similarity between this procedure and the summation procedure. Thus we can define another procedure called the <code>accumulate</code> and abstract away the idea of summation and multiplication into two different methods of doing the same thing; accumulating.</p> <pre><code>(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)\n(if (&gt; a b)\n    null-value\n    (combiner (term a)\n        (accumulate combiner null-value term (next a) next b))))\n\n(define (indentity x) x)\n(define (next x) (+ x 1))\n\n(accumulate + 0 identity 1 next 5) ;; prints 15\n\n(accumulate * 1 identity 1 next 5) ;; prints 120\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>combiner</code> in the above procedure is a procedure that takes in two inputs and combines them. For addition this is <code>+</code> and for multiplication this is <code>*</code>.</p> <p>The <code>null-value</code> is the value to be used when the range runs out.

The standard version of Emacs without any extra plugins comes with a text-editor, an interpreter (for Emacs-Lisp), a package manager (for Emacs), a Planner (org-mode), a Calendar, a File manager, and a mail/news reader all rolled into one eco-system. At a fundamental level Emacs is an interpreter for Emacs-Lisp, all of these goodness comes from the awesomeness of LISP (or eLISP in this case).</p> <p>I am unable to form sentences about stuff I wanna say and I really like lists. So, I will list out stuff and go on explaining them.</p> <p>This is a list of the reasons why I like Emacs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Config : The Emacs config is just a eLisp script. This enables   it to be loaded dynamically and the changes also reflect dynamically   without having to restart the application. A configuration written   in eLisp means that you do not have to learn some weird brain-dead   language just to configure a text editor (I'm looking   at Vim script).</p> </li> <li> <p>Literate Programming :   By default the Emacs configuration file init.el to store the Emacs   config. This becomes messy as after some time you end up with a   mess. Thus I decided that it would be a good idea to store the user   config is a separate file and have Emacs generate the actual   configuration from it . So I write my config in an Org-mode file and   I let Emacs handle the   rest. This is where I   have uploaded my Emacs config. The file init.el is the default   Emacs config file. I write my config in the config.org file and   Emacs generates the file config.el</p> </li> <li> <p>Evil : This mode allows me   to use vim key-bindings. Thus I did not have to retrain the muscle   memory to learn Emacs</p> </li> <li> <p>Magit : Used to manage git repos. Magit is   a Git porcelain. It exposes a lot of gits high level functionality   through a very easy to use interface. The best thing that magit did   for me was that it got in the habit of staging only certain files or   sometimes even parts of a file really easily. Also magit logs are so   much better than git log</p> </li> <li> <p>Org-mode : This mode is just   phenomenal. It is a mode where Emacs does incredibly amazing things   with just text files. Before using org-mode I had struggled a lot   with to-do lists. The first thing that org-mode did for me was to   remove that problem from my life. After using it for sometime I   wanted to configure org-mode for myself and it was very easy to do   so. So at this point I have a configure-able to-do list   application. But there are other uses more fascinating than the   to-do list thingy. Org-mode files being just text files are   incredibly easy to read even if you do not have Emacs. Thus you are   not dependent on Emacs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open-ness : The documentation part of Emacs is like the Cherry on   top. Emacs is like the truly Free and Open Source software. Since   it is written in LISP which is not compiled, we can view every   source code that is used in Emacs. In-fact most of the plugins that   are installed are just big elisp files. Thus, technically it is very   much possible for a user to change the code of Emacs while it is   running. In-fact this is exactly what we do when we change the config   file and load it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Documentation : Emacs embraces documentation like a boss. With   Emacs you have complete transparency. Using the help menu you can   see anything you want about emacs' internals. This includes   variables that are defined within Emacs, definition/descriptions of   proceudres (yes!! you can type a procedure name and Emacs would pull   up the procedure description, if you want then you could visit the   file where the procedure is defined and change it and the changes   would be reflected dynamically (you would still have to eval the   file(s) that you have changed)). Apart from that you can also query   keybindgins and Emacs will tell you which functions is that key   bound to. This is particularly very useful when you want to figure   out what a key-binding is doing (look at the procedure definiton and   so on!!). IMHO no other editor even comes close to this   feature. This self-documenting feature was a life saver for me when   I was starting out with Emacs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Writing Documents : I really hate using a word-processor and   honestly sometimes using LibreOffice is not so much fun. With   org-mode I can just write a file in org-mode and then export it to   any desired format. And this export is not a shitty export. Org-Mode   actually creates a hierarchical index based on the highlights in   org-mode. Moreover Org-mode can export the three main formats that I   need the most - odt, pdf, md (the markdown looks beautiful)</p> </li> <li> <p>Dired : The Emacs file manager. Dired is the file manager that   comes with Emacs. Now how many of you have tried to install a file   browser in vim because that makes it easier to navigate the source   code directory ?... Yeah.. Emacs has that built-in. Which means that   it was much well integrated with the rest of the stuff and also that   you do not have to put yourself through the agony of installing a   new plugin</p> </li> <li> <p>Package System : Emacs has its own package manager and its own   repositories. This means that installing a new package is as simple   as 'M-x package-install  package-name '. Emacs will find   the package, download it, compile it and do the necessary things on   its own. Configuring the packages requires some more work but that   is also taken care of by the configuration system <li> <p>Helm-mode :  This is  a   framework  that  enables  you  to  quickly  access  anything  within   Emacs. This  means that  with its  fuzzy matching,  it can  fish for   commands even before you have finished typing your command. Thus you   can look  for Emacs commands and  files very fast. It  uses an async   library in the back-end that makes it this fast.</p> </li> <li> <p>LISP : Emacs is the best possible IDE for learning   LISP. With Geiser I can now run a   scheme REPL inside Emacs while I write code and then execute them   from the file itself. This is just seamless and amazing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server mode :   Emacs is quite heavy, so it takes some time to startup. This means   that the typical workflow which I used to have with vim would never   work here. With vim i would just open a new instance of vim wherever   I needed it. Vim is small and fast. But with Emacs it doesn't make   sense to open a new instance of Emacs for editing a new file. The   solution is to us the Emacs Server Mode. In this mode Emacs runs a   server daemon and we can use the program 'emacsclient' to connect to   the server. Emacsclient does not create a new instance of Emacs,   instead it connects to the Emacs server and merely opens a new frame   or it sends that file to the already opened frame. After editing the   file we can close that file and it will be saved normally. Thus now   I can edit a file from anywhere I want within this system. Also   editing the desktop entry to Emacs enabled me to add a code snippet   that will call emacsclient whenever I try to open any text file from   the File Manager.</p> </li>","tags":["cs","linux"]},{"location":"the-emacs-way/#Other-Cool-stuff","title":"Other Cool stuff","text":"<p>Here are some other interesting things that you can do with Emacs that I want to try out.</p> <ul> <li>elfeed : This is a client   that reads RSS and ATOM feeds.</li> <li>mail client : Some of my friends use Emacs as their email client.

Custodians Online","text":"<p>In solidarity with Library Genesis and Sci-Hub.</p> <p>In Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry's tale the Little Prince meets a businessman who accumulates stars with the sole purpose of being able to buy more stars. The Little Prince is perplexed. He owns only a flower, which he waters every day. Three volcanoes, which he cleans every week. \"It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them,\" he says, \"but you are of no use to the stars that you own\".</p> <p>There are many businessmen who own knowledge today. Consider Elsevier, the largest scholarly publisher, whose 37% profit margin1 stands in sharp contrast to the rising fees, expanding student loan debt and poverty-level wages for adjunct faculty. Elsevier owns some of the largest databases of academic material, which are licensed at prices so scandalously high that even Harvard, the richest university of the global north, has complained that it cannot afford them any longer. Robert Darnton, the past director of Harvard Library, says \"We faculty do the research, write the papers, referee papers by other researchers, serve on editorial boards, all of it for free \u2026 and then we buy back the results of our labour at outrageous prices.\"2 For all the work supported by public money benefiting scholarly publishers, particularly the peer review that grounds their legitimacy, journal articles are priced such that they prohibit access to science to many academics - and all non-academics - across the world, and render it a token of privilege.</p> <p>Elsevier has recently filed a copyright infringement suit in New York against Science Hub and Library Genesis claiming millions of dollars in damages. This has come as a big blow, not just to the administrators of the websites but also to thousands of researchers around the world for whom these sites are the only viable source of academic materials. The social media, mailing lists and IRC channels have been filled with their distress messages, desperately seeking articles and publications.</p> <p>Even as the New York District Court was delivering its injunction, news came of the entire editorial board of highly-esteemed journal Lingua handing in their collective resignation, citing as their reason the refusal by Elsevier to go open access and give up on the high fees it charges to authors and their academic institutions. As we write these lines, a petition is doing the rounds demanding that Taylor &amp; Francis doesn't shut down Ashgate, a formerly independent humanities publisher that it acquired earlier in 2015. It is threatened to go the way of other small publishers that are being rolled over by the growing monopoly and concentration in the publishing market. These are just some of the signs that the system is broken. It devalues us, authors, editors and readers alike. It parasites on our labor, it thwarts our service to the public, it denies us access.</p> <p>We have the means and methods to make knowledge accessible to everyone, with no economic barrier to access and at a much lower cost to society. But closed access\u2019s monopoly over academic publishing, its spectacular profits and its central role in the allocation of academic prestige trump the public interest. Commercial publishers effectively impede open access, criminalize us, prosecute our heroes and heroines, and destroy our libraries, again and again. Before Science Hub and Library Genesis there was Library.nu or Gigapedia; before Gigapedia there was textz.com; before textz.com there was little; and before there was little there was nothing. That's what they want: to reduce most of us back to nothing. And they have the full support of the courts and law to do exactly that.</p> <p>In Elsevier's case against Sci-Hub and Library Genesis, the judge said: \"simply making copyrighted content available for free via a foreign website, disserves the public interest\"8. Alexandra Elbakyan's original plea put the stakes much higher: \"If Elsevier manages to shut down our projects or force them into the darknet, that will demonstrate an important idea: that the public does not have the right to knowledge.\"</p> <p>We demonstrate daily, and on a massive scale, that the system is broken. We share our writing secretly behind the backs of our publishers, circumvent paywalls to access articles and publications, digitize and upload books to libraries. This is the other side of 37% profit margins: our knowledge commons grows in the fault lines of a broken system. We are all custodians of knowledge, custodians of the same infrastructures that we depend on for producing knowledge, custodians of our fertile but fragile commons. To be a custodian is, de facto, to download, to share, to read, to write, to review, to edit, to digitize, to archive, to maintain libraries, to make them accessible. It is to be of use to, not to make property of, our knowledge commons.</p> <p>More than seven years ago Aaron Swartz, who spared no risk in standing up for what we here urge you to stand up for too, wrote: \"We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge \u2014 we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?\"</p> <p>We find ourselves at a decisive moment. This is the time to recognize that the very existence of our massive knowledge commons is an act of collective civil disobedience. It is the time to emerge from hiding and put our names behind this act of resistance. You may feel isolated, but there are many of us. The anger, desperation and fear of losing our library infrastructures, voiced across the internet, tell us that. This is the time for us custodians, being dogs, humans or cyborgs, with our names, nicknames and pseudonyms, to raise our voices.</p> <p>Share this letter - read it in public - leave it in the printer.

But, make no mistake, it is not a traditional package manager. It is a package manager on steroids. I will explain what I mean by on steroids. </p> <p>Some of the most important and most powerful features of the Guix package manager IMHO are ...</p> <ul> <li> <p>The gnu store (<code>/gnu/store/</code>) is heart of the Guix package manager. This is the directory where all the packages and profile are stored in Guix. Unlike traditional package managers where the packages are stored in either <code>/bin</code> or <code>/usr/bin/</code> or anything, in Guix all the packages that are installed are installed under the <code>/gnu/store/</code> directory and the entire system is a web of symbolic links.</p> </li> <li> <p>Per-user profiles In guix packages are not installed globally. Traditionally in GNU/Linux when some package is installed it is available for use by everyone in the system with no exceptions. This makes sense because traditionally the packages are installed in the file-system itself, so there is no way of separating which user has which package. </p> <p>Things are quite different on the Guix Land (I apologize to the community for using Guix Land(I couldn't help myself)). In Guix, packages are managed using per-user profiles. This means that every user on the system has their own profile which makes sure that they have the packages that they want to use and nothing else. This also means that in guix installing packages does not need superuser privileges, since everyone can have authority over which packages they want to use. How Guix accomplishes this by using a series of symbolic links the actual binaries which reside in the Gnu Store. So if two users have different packages then it means that they just have different symbolic links pointing to the actual binaries in the gnu store. Same goes for different users having different versions of the same package.</p> <p>The per-user-profiles are stored under the directory <code>~/.guix-profile</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Purely Functional approach to package management. A pure function is a function that produces the same output every-time given the same set of arguments. Guix embraces this idea. Every package build in guix is treated as a function in which the inputs are the compiler, libraries, build scripts, etc and the output is the built package. This along with isolated build environment (I don't know much about it as I haven't had time to explore it yet) ensures that built packages are bit-identical even when they are built on different machines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transactional Upgrades and Rollbacks Guix package upgrades are transactional in nature, this means that either the entire upgrade takes place or nothing gets upgraded so in case of a power-failure during upgrade, your system will not be left in a corrupt state. </p> <p>Also package upgrades, installs etc can be rolled back (yes! just like in git!!)</p> </li> <li> <p>Guile Guix is completely written in GNU Guile which is a dialect of LISP. </p> </li> </ul> <p>There are lots of more fun stuff that I could write about but </p> <ol> <li>I haven't explored the system enough to talk about it in detail and I do not want to speculate at this point</li> <li>Things will get really long.. really fast</li> </ol>","tags":["cs","linux","tech","bash"]},{"location":"gnu-guix---part-1/#What-is-GuixSD-","title":"What is GuixSD ?","text":"<p>GuixSD is the Linux Based Operating system built around the GUIX package manager.</p> <p>GuixSD or the Guix System Distribution is an advanced distribution of the GNU operating system developed by the GNU Project\u2014which respects the freedom of computer users. </p> <p>That is what it says on their main website.

During this step one is required to mount the target file system under /mnt and then mount the other related file-systems relative to <code>/mnt</code>. This means that if you want to have a custom boot dir then you would have to mount it at <code>/mnt/boot</code>.</p> <p>On the contrary if you are using a UEFI system then you are required to have an esp (efi system partition) and you have to mount it at <code>/boot/efi</code>. This mount point should not be relative. i.e. you should not mount the esp at <code>/mnt/boot/efi</code> but instead at <code>/boot/efi</code>. This was weird for me and this caused a lot of trouble for me.</p> </li> <li> <p>Final installation In this step we configure our system and install it.     The guix System Configuration is the most important thing to get right while installing Guix. This file is responsible for setting up the entire system including users, groups, and services (guix uses Gnu Shepherd as the service manager)</p> <p>This config file is nothing but a Scheme file which is read by the Guix package manager when you are installing the system. </p> <p>The default configurations that are provided are quite good for normal everyday use. If however you need to use a more complex configuration you can refer to my configuration (my config is a dual-booted uefi setup with Arch Linux)</p> </li> </ol> <p>NOTE: In Guix if you are dual-booting please make sure that the bootloader is installed properly since if it is not, you CAN NOT use the traditional fixes that we are used to (like bootrepair, or grub reinstall etc) because of how the GuixSD system is structured internally.</p>","tags":["cs","linux","tech","bash"]},{"location":"gnu-guix---part-1/#After-Installation","title":"After Installation","text":"<p>So, installation is only half the trouble.

To establish the equality between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) we do not need to and we can not count the number of elements in each set and show that they are equal, we just need to show that if counting the number of elements were possible then the sets would be equal.

Computers and the whole computer science field was not yet born. So in this context a computer was something (or someone) that could perform arithmetic operations. Humans who did this were called human computers There were mechanical calculators that existed back then but again, they all required a human operator.</p> <p>So ultimately it was the operator who was responsible for making decisions about what to do with the numbers. There was not automated reasoning that any machine could follow.</p> <p>What Alan Turing was interested in; was to understand the meaning of what it means for a task to be computable. This is one of the core areas in Philosophy of Computer Science. However to answer this question he needed a a formal definition of computation itself (which did not exist at that time). </p> <p>NOTE : As a mental exercise before doing anything else just sit back and think about this yourself. We use computers daily but at its very core, what does computation mean ?</p> <p>So in order to have a formal definition of computation we needed a model for computation.

The Turing Machine is heavily inspired by this system (typewriter + operator). In the book \"Alan Turing: The Enigma\" the writer Andrew Hodges tells us that Alan was fascinated by typewriters. We can see this inspiring his work.</p> <p>What does a typewriter have ? A typewriter has a paper for printing, a system that outputs characters on said paper, a mechanism for input that tells the typewriter what to print.  Additionally the typewriter system also has the user whose job is to tell the typewrite what to do and it keeps track of what the typewriter has already done.</p> <p>Now, the Turing Machine is a hypothetical machine (or more precisely a mathematical model); it does not exist in real life. It is a state machine which means that the machine has a finite number of states in which it can be. It can read information/instructions from a tape and based on that it moves from one state to another. The number of states is finite. It can also write data on the tape.</p> <p>A Turing Machine has 4 main parts:</p> <ul> <li>The tape</li> <li>The head</li> <li>The state</li> <li>The transition table</li> </ul> <p>The tape is the memory of the machine. The tape is divided into blocks of the same width and only one symbol is present in one block. The machine can read symbols from this tape and can write symbols to this tape. At a given time there is only one symbol in the machine. This symbol is referred to as the scanned symbol. The machine can be supplied with an infinitely long tape.</p> <p>The head is a contraption that can read symbols from the tape and can write symbols to the tape as well. The head can also move the tape to the left or right but by only one block at a time.</p> <p>The state of the Turing Machine. This state is a intriguing concept. This state is used to replace the state of mind of the typewriter operator (or any person performing any computation for that matter). At any time the Turing Machine can be one of many finite states.</p> <p>The transition table is a set of finite rules that given the current state the machine is currently and the scanned symbol tells the Turing Machine to write a symbol into the tape, then move the tape left or right and finally to assume a new state (or stay in the same one).</p> <p>Now the Turing Machine is a model of computation, thus it must be able to do some computation; right? So how does it do that. </p>","tags":["cs"]},{"location":"turing-machine-and-halting-problem/#Problems-for-a-Turing-Machine","title":"Problems for a Turing Machine.","text":"<p>Problems in Automata Theory are generally of the form that involves some \"computer\" determining if some string belongs to a set of strings or not, based on some rules. This set of strings is called that follow a general rule for membership is called a Language and the \"computer\" involved is called an automaton which is nothing but a model of computation. We choose to represent various computational problems as languages because we already have established a terminology for dealing with languages.</p> <p>To perform some computation in a Turing Machine we write a program for the machine. This program is basically a set of transition rules.</p> <p>Given any string as input the Turing Machine can do one of three things. It can stop and accept the string or it can reject the string or it can loop indefinitely over the input.</p> <p>When the TM is in either the accept or the reject state after processing a string then we say that the TM has halted (as in stopped running on the output). On the other hand if the TM does not halt and instead keeps on looping indefinitely then it means that the TM will never stop working or never halt. When a TM has halted it indicates that the TM has decided the string (either accept or reject) on the other hand when it does not halt then the string (or rather the problem) is said to be undecidable.</p> <p>All this can get quite intense, so here is an intuitive definition of computation by a Turing Machine. The Church-Turing thesis showed that a Turing Machine algorithm captures all algorithms. This means that if for a given problem we can design a Turing Machine algorithms then that problem is actually solvable. As we will soon see that there are certain problems that are so complex that there exists no algorithm that can solve them. In-fact while describing Turing Machine algorithms we do not need to go into the implementation level details of how the head and the tapes move; instead we can just use English prose to describe an algorithm.

I was not too worried about the physical part since I walk a lot on a regular basis and I also started running after moving to Mumbai.</p> <p>However for this trek I needed to buy some rather expensive equipment. I needed to buy one rucksack, and some clothing for the low temperature and shoes. The clothing was most important. I did not want to buy something too expensive and too specialized for the trek. I wanted something more versatile.</p> <p>Buying the rucksack was easy. I bought a 60L pack. I really wanted to buy a 70L but realized that it would be too much.</p> <p>Buying the clothing was more fun! When you are selecting clothing for treks, you want to be as efficient as possible because everything you own, you have to carry it yourself. One of the techniques is to use layering. There are plenty of good websites online that talk about layering (fyi. the layering information on IndiaHikes site is shit and absolutely not reliable).</p> <p>The layering can be quite complicated but ultimately it boils down to minimizing the loss of heat (clothes do not generate heat, instead they keep you warm by minimizing heat loss). So tl;dr I bought two polyester base layers and one hollow-fill jacket from decathlon. The hollow-fill jacket was good enough for heat but under certain extreme windy conditions I did find it a bit too cold as it is not completely wind-proof. But it was good enough for this trek.</p> <p>For shoes I decided to rent a pair from IndiaHikes.</p>","tags":["env","travel","trek"]},{"location":"sandakphu-trek/#The-Trek","title":"The Trek","text":"<p>The trek was from 22<sup>nd</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup> of December. We picked this batch hoping that we would get extreme cold temperature.</p> <p>On 22<sup>nd</sup> we met the rest of the team the NJP station in West Bengal and we started off to Jaubhari. Jaubhari is the IndiaHikes base camp for the Sandakphu trek.  At Jaubhari we were briefed about the trek by our trek leader. I was really surprised to know about the various activities that IndiaHikes does on the mountains to make the treks more sustainable. Someone from IndiaHikes also briefed the entire team about the benefits of using menstrual cups which I found really cool! After this out medical parameters were checked and recorded, followed by some dinner. Jaubhari is at 2134 meters.</p> <p>At Jaubhari we also received our rented equipment. I rented a shoe but for some reason I could not feel comfortable in them. They felt different. So against the advise of the trek leaders and other fellow trekkers I decided to continue the trek in my regular shoes.</p> <p>One 23<sup>rd</sup>, we reached Tumling which was at 2970 meters. The trek was fun. We stopped in the middle of the trek for lunch. At Tumling the temp was somewhere around 2-5 C.</p> <p>On the way to Tumling the waist belt of the pack of a fellow trekker got ripped. At Tumling we managed to get hold of some needle and thread and stitched the ripped belt. It was a hacky job but the belt worked till the last day of the trek. Note to self: Carry needles and nylon thread.</p> <p>One thing that was constant throughout the trek were the view of the Everest on the left and Kanchenjunga on the right. We could see them everyday, which is a welcome change from the normal stuff we are used to seeing everyday. :-P</p> <p>Lhotse, Everest, Makalu peaks from the right.</p> <p></p> <p>The weather was quite cold which was quite enjoyable for me. I went for a walk after dinner to experience the cold and also to test my jacket. I did remove my jacket for a bit and it got too cold too fast. The jacket was doing its job perfectly and I was satisfied with my purchase. :-P</p> <p>On 24<sup>th</sup> we reached Kalipokhri which is at 3170 meters. I do not remember the details of this days trek. I do remember that at Kalipokhri all of us gathered in the hut where we were supposed to have dinner a all of us sang. It was a beautiful experience.</p> <p>Kanchenjunga.       </p> <p></p> <p>After dinner I headed out for another walk. I told three people that I would be going outside and where I would be going and gave them a tentative timeframe. There was a short hill nearby our lodge. I fancied walking up it in the morning but couldn't. So now was my time. It was exceptionally dark although the moon was present. thankfully my headlamp came handy. I was climbing the hill from the leeward side so I could not figure out the wind speed. On top it was another story. It was extremely windy. It was good. This was a good place.</p> <p>On 25<sup>th</sup> we reached Sandakphu which was at 3577 meters. It was quite cold, but the views were amazing. </p> <p>The trek to sandakphu was mostly thorough a motor-able road although there were certain shortcuts which were somewhat more technical than the road. Wile trekking we were also picking up small pieces of plastic. I managed to pick up a used sanitary napkin (who the fuck throws a sanitary napkin out there). Anyway, I also managed to annoy a co-trekker when I was being stupid and picked up a water bottle that was not in a safe position (sorry!!).</p> <p>We had some time to kill in Sandakphu so we all got together and sang and played dumb charades. It was my turn and I froze completely (again!!). At this point I should just stop playing these games.</p> <p>We also saw the milky-way. This was the first time I was seeing the Milky Way and it was amazing. :-)</p> <p>On 26<sup>th</sup>, we left from Sandakphu and went to Sabargram located at 3600 meters. This place was really cold. I helped pitch some toilet tents. </p> <p>We also managed to do some amazing photography and got good shots of the milky-way.</p> <p>This was our camp location at Sabargram.</p> <p></p> <p>On 27<sup>th</sup> we were supposed to reach Phalut which is at 3642 meters and then descend back to Gorkhey which is at 2300 meters. This day was too much fun. By the end of the trek I was running down the hill along with our guide Buddha Ji.</p> <p>There is a river flowing through Gorkhey and some of us went there to dip our feet in the stream. I managed to slip and fall down into the river; thankfully I did not get too wet otherwise I would be in trouble. </p> <p>Me and an equally crazy co-trekker decided to compete about who can keep their feet in the cold water for the longest time. I won that competition. The water wasn't that cold.</p> <p>As this was the second last day of the trek we all gathers in the men's dorm and everyone shared small bits and pieces about what they would be taking away from the trek. This was another noteworthy experience.</p> <p>28<sup>th</sup> marked the last day of the trek and quite possibly the last day some of us would ever see each other again. We started off early in the morning and we reached the final spot at Sepi well ahead of time. </p> <p>We had lunch and then we took vehicles to Jaubhari (base camp) where we were supposed to return our rental equipment and pick up other stuff for the journey back home.</p> <p>The journey to Jaubhari wasn't too special, except everyone was tired and I think everyone knew that the trek had already ended. It felt kinda sad to realize that there was a very good chance that none of us would see each other ever again.</p> <p>The journey from Jaubhari to NJP was quite interesting. We had a train to catch so we were under the clock. On top of that the weather got significantly worse and it started snowing heavily. It was snowing so much that we couldn't see the road ahead, thankfully though, the driver of the jeep knew the route and he cold drive under those conditions. I puked on the way (Is it really trekking if you don't puke). We reached the railway station to find that the train was delayed. We all said our goodbyes and promised to stay in touch. </p> <p>And that was it.

Whenever I am having some (any!!) trouble, or I can not understand something I am studying or I start feeling lonely, I go for a walk. I enjoy the conversations I have with myself during these walks. I walk to unwind after a stressful day. I regularly walk home (roughly 6 kms) after a weird day at work.</p> <p>Trekking is something that ties all of this together in some weird sort of way.

I had 7 hours. I needed to finish some work as well. Went to a friends house and left some of my stuff (the laptop) there. I had assumed that I would leave for the trek well rested, but by the time I was in the bus, i was carrying 7 hours of extra sweat.</p> <p>All said and done I met with Sonakshi and Niranjan at Majestic at the stipulated time . We had 2 idlis for dinner. I was under the impression that I would be able to get bananas from Kukke-Subramanya but I was mistaken. In the morning none of the shops would be open. So, the others made me buy the wonder fruit. We also got a bunch of peanut brittles.</p> <p>The bus started on time, but it reached Kukke-Subramanya at 0430 hrs in the morning. This was almost an hour before my schedule. We decided not to waste too much time and hit the trail right away. </p> <p>It was pitch dark and my head lamp was not working. We figured out a way to make it work with me walking in the middle of the group and using the torch on my powerbank. I did not want to use my phone as a torch because I was recording the entire trek in OSMAND with continuous logging.</p> <p>We reached Buttaramane soon enough. We stopped there for some time for food and the loo. We also filled our water bottles. I had to brush my teeth due to peer pressure. We had some lemon rice and got three plates packed to carry with us. The forest office was nearby from here.</p> <p>At the forest office we had to pay for entry and had to get our bags inspected We could also leave some stuff at the forest office so as to reduce the load that we would be carrying. I didn't leave anything behind. I was kinda-sorta training for the next trek.</p> <p>The trek was amazing. It is a pretty trek. We were not trekking for the view anyway. The thing I like about Kumaraparvatha is the challenge. It is a long trek. 12kms in one direction. Generally people hike up to the forest office in a day and use the next day to trek up-to the peak and back. The forest officials do not allow anyone into the forest after 12 noon. Its almost 6 kms to the peak from the forest office, and also more technical, so if you do not start from the forest office before 12 noon, it can get dangerous.</p> <p>In this photo we have Sonakshi and Niranjan far into the frame.  </p> <p>On the way to the top there is a section where you come across a steep rock-face which looked inviting. But Sonakshi and Niranjan being the saner members of the group stopped me from climbing via that route. I was disappointed.</p> <p>The Big rock face is question. (it is Not as steep as it looks) </p> <p>We reached the top in about 6 hours. We slept for a very very short time and had the packed food before starting back. By this time it was afternoon and the sun was over our heads. We did not have too much water with us as well.</p> <p>We took some photos from the somewhere near the top</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This is the other side from the same location </p> <p>The first part of the descent was somewhat difficult because of the heat, and we ran out of water just before reaching Buttaramane but nothing too much. I got disoriented a bit and kept slippin. A banana fixed it. We waited at the forest office for some time and then headed to Buttaramane. We refilled our bottles here and started off again. From then the journey was fun. We kept descending at a faster pace, we were almost running downhill. We took a detour went to a stream nearby. Dipping our feet in the stream felt amazing. We waited for about half an hour here before leaving.</p> <p>We exited the forest at about 1800 hours. Our bus was at 22:30 hrs, so we had a bunch of hours to kill. We jumped around for a bit legitimately impressed by our pace. The experienced folks told me that our pace was impressive. I trusted them.</p> <p>We had some food, sat on the road, and got kicked out of a restaurant. Then we boarded the bus and slept.</p> <p>We reached Bangalore quite early. I was trying to convince Sonakshi and Niranjan to come to the Savandurga trek with me but I was not successful. Niranjan said he would come. Then Sonakshi went her way, while me and Niranjan headed to his place. We were planning to freshen up (no showering) and then head to the meetup location for Savandurga. In the end Niranjan also ditched me. I removed the base layer I was wearing. That improved the smell a tiny bit.  I left Niranjans place and then had a friend pick me up on the rental car that we booked for Savandurga.

Savandurga..","text":"<p>My friend and I met with the rest of the group at 10:00 hrs which was 1 hours later than our plan. Anyway, we said our hellos and started. The drive wasn't that bad. We stopped on the middle for some food and stuff to pack.</p> <p>The road to Savandurga (via Magdi Road) is just beautiful. This was a familiar route since I had cycled through the same road about a year back. We could see the hill as we started to approach it. Some of the team members expressed their concerns over the difficulty of what awaited them.</p> <p>This is how Savndurga looks from the road. </p> <p>We reached Savandurga in about 90 minutes.The team was quite worried when we saw the monolith. We were making good time, however we wasted a decent amount of time eating stuff before we started trekking. </p> <p>The thing that makes Savandurga challenging is the gradient and the feature. It's steep. It's a short but a very steep climb. It's also just a rock. You are climbing on a rock. Which means that it heats up really fast and finding traction is quite difficult. On top of that there are not many trees on the rock, so shade is really hard to find as well. Finding a place to sit is also a challenge since once you are on the rock, there is a constant gradient. You are always tilted somewhere, so even if you decide to sit down, you have to make sure you do not slide down. Considering all this I really wanted to avoid the afternoon sun, but by the time we started it was almost 12 when we started.</p> <p>Look at the gradient. </p> <p>A friend got really exhausted during the climb and she decided that she would not continue. The plan was that she would wait at a resting spot and we would pick her up on the way down. </p> <p>As we continued up, a lot of the kids wanted to give up but they kept at it. There is a place on top of Savandurga which is just blow the peak (we will call this the 'spot').  The entire group decided to call it a day there and not continue till the peak itself, except Rohit and Nikhil and I. The three of us were quite pumped about the idea and decided to sprint to the top and come back ASAP.</p> <p>In my honest opinion the trek to the top from the spot is the most trickiest part since it has some of the more challenging terrain. Until now we were trekking on the rock itself, but the monolith plateaus at the spot and after that there is a section where you walk between huge boulders, a section where you have to squeeze between two boulders and a section just before the peak where you have to climb a very steep boulder. It's not too tough, just challenging. </p> <p>The top of Savandurga is where the temple is. The view from the top is just amazing. You can see the Manchanabele reservoir nearby and an all round view from the top of the largest monolith. We took a bunch of pics here.</p> <p>The view from the top. That is the temple below that we can see. That is the Manchanbele reservoir that we can see in the back </p> <p>On our way back we met the friend who decided to stay back just below the spot. She started feeling better so she decided to trek to the top herself. It was super awesome to see her so unexpectedly. She also had some food with her, which was very much needed. Needless to say, all of us were very much impressed by her. </p> <p>Descending was fun. I did something that I have always wanted to do. Run down the hill. Do not do this unless you know what you are doing. Its very very very dangerous to run down a hill which is as steep as Savandurga. </p> <p>This is how descending looks.  </p> <p>We had a mini celebration after descending from the hill. It was fun. These folks had completed their very first trek. </p> <p>This is the team. </p> <p>We returned to Bangalore soon enough. I took an hour long nap for the major part of the journey back home.

Now, pure functions are a mathematical concept. Mathematically a function just takes a value and returns a result. It does nothing else, or more specifically it changes nothing else. Moreover a function has to return the same result for the same argument always.</p> <p>Well, how does this translate into programming ?</p> <p>In programming terms, a pure function has to have no side effects Side effects is a term computer people use to confuse non-computer people. It means that a function should not mutate any mutable variables/references in the environment. This gets tricky sometimes, especially if the programming language allows and encourages mutations.  Object-Oriented languages allow mutation and that can lead to some interesting problems (and security vulnerabilities) in software.</p> <p>Essentially I wrote a lot of functional code for this course and its exercises and homework assignments.

The type checker can do this by <code>looking ahead</code> into the function and inspecting the operations being performed on the arguments. The intuition being that when you check if an argument value is equal to <code>0</code> or not, then the argument must be an integer. Similarly, if you are adding two arguments, they must be integers. To carry the idea forward, the static type checker would throw an error if you tried to perform some operation on incompatible types (like adding a string to an integer). This is also possible because the operators are not overloaded like how in python the <code>+</code> operator can do both addition for integers and concatenation for strings. Having non-overloaded operators means that every operator has a very specific type of operands that it accepts, and anything otherwise would not type-check.</p>","tags":["cs","learning"]},{"location":"programming-languages-part-a/#Polymorphic-Data-types","title":"Polymorphic Data-types","text":"<p>Another thing that I found beautiful was the concept of polymorphic types in SML. In SML the type checker can figure out if there is a more-general way to write your program so that it can work for more than a single type of arguments. It does this even if you specify a type. What this means is that your programs become more general. </p> <p>Let's write a function with polymorphic data-types.</p> <pre><code>fun add_to_list (x, y) =\n    x :: y;\n</code></pre> <p>The function <code>add_to_list</code> builds a list by taking a object and a list and adds the object to the front of the list. The type of this function is <code>fn: 'a * 'a list -&gt; 'a list</code> where <code>'a</code> is a polymorphic datatype as in it can take the type of any value passed to the function. Hence this function works for both integers and strings. </p> <p>Look the the results of the function calls in the comments.</p> <pre><code>add_to_list(2,[]); \n(* [2] : int list *)\nadd_to_list(2, [2,3]);\n(* [2,2,3] : int list *)\nadd_to_list(\"S\",[]);\n(* [\"S\"] : string list *)\nadd_to_list(\"S\",[\"t\",\"a\",\"r\",\"t\"]);\n(* [\"S\",\"t\",\"a\",\"r\",\"t\"] : string list *)\n</code></pre> <p>It should be noted  that this functions will only work  if the type of the object and the type of the object  that the list is made up of are the same. This  is by definition since in SML  the <code>::</code> operator works like that. Hence the following call will not type check because we are trying to add <code>S</code> to the list <code>[2,3]</code>.</p> <pre><code>add_to_list(\"S\",[2,3]);\n(* Does not type check *)\n</code></pre>","tags":["cs","learning"]},{"location":"programming-languages-part-a/#Pattern-Matching","title":"Pattern Matching","text":"<p>Writing about pattern matching is tricky because it makes absolutely no sense without any context, and in order to establish context we would another series of blog posts which is not where I want to go with this. Let me try.</p> <p>Imagine a <code>case</code> expression. The utility of a case expression lies in the fact that a case expression can handle multiple branches or multiple cases.</p> <p>The case expression in SML has the form</p> <pre><code>case expr_0 of\n    patt_1 =&gt; expr_1\n  | patt_2 =&gt; expr_2\n  | ...\n  | patt_n =&gt; expr_n\n</code></pre> <p>This is evaluated by first evaluating the <code>expr_0</code> to <code>val_0</code> and then pattern-matching it with <code>patt_i</code> and then based on which pattern it matches with, the corresponding <code>expr_i</code> is evaluated.</p> <p>The pattern part is super cool because it lets you use constructors and operators within the pattern to pattern match against and you can also do variable binding within the pattern itself. </p> <p>Let's see that in action. In the following program I will add all the elements of a list together.</p> <pre><code>fun add_list(xs) =\n    case xs of\n        [] =&gt; 0\n     | x::xs' =&gt; x + add_list(xs');\n\nadd_list([]);\nadd_list([2]);\nadd_list([2,3,4]);\n</code></pre> <p>In this example basically we are matching against the cases where the list is either empty or not. If the list is empty we return 0 as the sum, otherwise we use pattern matching to split the list into the first element and the rest of the list (without the first element) and then recursively compute the sum.</p>","tags":["cs","learning"]},{"location":"programming-languages-part-a/#Lexical-Scope-and-Closures","title":"Lexical Scope and Closures","text":"<p>The body of a function is evaluated in the environment where the function is defined, not the environment where the function is called.</p> <p>We will see it in this example.</p> <pre><code>val x = 2;\nfun test (y) = y + x;\nval x = 4;\ntest(3)\n(* 5 *)\n</code></pre> <p>The output of this function is <code>5</code> and not <code>9</code> because when the function <code>test</code> was defined, the value of <code>x = 2</code> in the environment.

This environment contains the bindings at the time when the function was defined.  This associating of a function and its environment (lexical environment) is called a function closure, or simply; a closure.</p> <p>Closures are really cool.

Mathematically we can define the factorial of a number as</p> <p>factorial(n) = n * factorial (n - 1) ; when n &gt; 1</p> <p>We can write this in SML like,</p> <pre><code>fun factorial(x) =\n    if x=0\n    then 1\n    else x * factorial(x - 1)\n</code></pre> <p>Now, this is fine and it works; BUT, its not tail recursive.  This is because the calling function has to multiply the result from the recursive call with <code>x</code> and then get the result.</p> <p>Let's write the tail recursive version of this.</p> <pre><code>fun fac_tail(n) =\n    let fun helper(acc, n) =\n            if n=0\n            then acc\n            else helper(n * acc, n -1)\n        in\n        helper(1,n)\n    end;\n</code></pre> <p>Over here we have a helper function that takes two parameters.  The first parameter stores the value of <code>factorial(n - 1)</code> and the second one keeps track of <code>n</code>. </p> <p>If we look at how we are calling the helper function recursively, we see that after the recursive call returns a value, we do not need to perform any operations on the result, since it is already the result we want. This is a tail call. </p> <p>The benefits of tail calls is that compilers are smart enough to optimize tail calls and hence these recursive calls are not as expensive computationally.</p> <p>Moreover, because of lexical scoping we can use any variable binding in the helper function without explicitly passing it during every call. This makes for very readable code. Using an accumulator to store the intermediate results also helps us avoid re-computation of already computed values.

This is called applicative order evaluation.</p> <p>For example consider this function which tries to emulate the functionality of the 'if' expression.</p> <pre><code>(define (my-if a b c)\n    (if a b c))\n</code></pre> <p>Let's use this 'my-if' as we would use a normal if clause</p> <pre><code>(my-if (= 2 3) 2 3)\n;; result :=&gt; 3\n</code></pre> <p>This works properly. However, the next one doesn't.</p> <pre><code>(my-if (= 2 3) (1 2) (2 3))\n;; result :=&gt; Error\n</code></pre> <p>This is because when 'my-if' is being evaluated, then all the three arguments to the function is evaluated first before evaluating 'my-if'. This does not happen when we use the normal 'if' conditional because if is a special form. It evaluates the conditional argument first and based on that result it evaluates either of the branches.</p> <p>There should be a way of passing around expression in a language without actually evaluating them. In Racket we can do this by wrapping the function that we want to dealy in a lambda function that takes no arguments. Thus we can pass this lambda function around as much as  we want and we can evaluate it when we need it by using an extras set of parenthesis.</p> <p>Thus we need to rewrite the old functions. We can do it as</p> <pre><code>(define (new-if a b c)\n    (if a (b) (c)))\n</code></pre> <p>and we will call this function as </p> <pre><code>(new-if (= 2 3) \n        (lambda () (1 2))\n        (lambda () (2 3)))\n</code></pre> <p>This is called thunking. When we wrap a function in an empty lambda function, then we create a thunk. Instead of 'e1' we use '(lambda () e1)'. So when the thunk is passed to a function, the thunk gets evaluated first into the function and then we can evaluate the function to get the result.</p> <p>This is just one of the many programming idioms that are there that we can use to mess around with the order of evaluation in a program.</p>","tags":["cs","learning","f","t"]},{"location":"programming-languages-part-b/#Delay--Force-call-by-need-or-lazy-evaluation-or-promises","title":"Delay &amp; Force (call by need or lazy evaluation or promises)","text":"<p>So thunking provides us a solution to the problem of evaluating expression that are not needed.

We can store the thunk of the function in a cons cell along with the result.

It is never ending. This is a very hand-wavy definition and it does not paint a truthful picture but it is good enough for now. Streams are produced by something called as a producer. The producers knows only how to produce a stream of data endlessly.</p> <p>Now, that we have an endless stream of data, what do we do with it ? This is where consumers come in. Consumers consume the data from the stream in whatever manner they want.</p> <p>A good analogy is rivers. A glacier is the producer which produces and endless stream of water and humans are the consumers. The consumers get to decide how to and how much to consume the stream.</p> <p>Constructing an endless source of data is quite impossible since you never really know when to stop. So how do producers produce an endless stream of data ? To do that producers use a short-cut. To construct an infinite stream of data all you need is a starting point and a method to go to the next point. With these two information you can create data on-demand without needing to know when to stop.</p> <p>We will try to understand this with an example.</p> <p>Consider the set of all Natural Numbers which we can all agree that is an infinite set.</p> <p>How would one go about printing out all the natural numbers if the entire set is infinite ?</p> <p>The answer is that one does not need to print all the natural numbers all at once. All one needs to do is to keep track of the current number being printed and then increment the number by 1 when the next natural number is needed. In this case the starting point is 1 and the method of obtaining the next number is that you increment the current number by 1.</p> <p>This gives us a good starting point of how to go about designing streams.  In a stream (in this case) the flow of data is controlled by the consumer as data is produced only when it is asked for by the consumer and the only two pieces of information needed by either the producer or the consumer is the starting element of the stream and the formula.</p> <p>So we can code up streams by writing a thunk that evaluates to a pair wherein the first element is the first element and the second element is a thunk that has everything we need to get all the elements from 2 to infinity.</p> <p>Let us write a stream that just produces an infinite stream of 1's</p> <pre><code>(define ones-st (lambda () (cons 1 ones)))\n\n;; we call this stream by\n\n;; this gives the first element\n(car (one-st))\n\n;; this gives us the second element\n(car (cdr (one-st)))\n</code></pre> <p>The stream is a thunk which when evaluated gives a pair. The first element in the pair is the first value in the stream and the second element is another thunk. We can clearly see how this works in the way we call it.</p> <p>This stream is a bit easy to understand since there is not transformation that is taking place between the subsequent elements.</p> <p>Now we will define the same stream and put a transformation function in the middle. This function will not do anything but it will act as a good placeholder for future transformations.</p> <pre><code>(define (ones)\n    (define (ones-help x)\n    (cons x (lambda () (ones-help (+ x 0)))))\n(ones-help 1))\n</code></pre> <p>In this way we have a framework of how to go about designing different streams.  Let use write an infinite stream of the square of all the natural numbers.</p> <pre><code>(define (square)\n    (define (square-help x)\n    (cons (* x x) (lambda () (square-help (+ x 1)))))\n(square-help 1))\n</code></pre> <p>How do we get elements from the stream ? </p> <p>To get the first element we evaluate the stream and get the first element form the pair. To get the second element from the stream we evaluate the cdr of the pair we get.</p> <pre><code>(car (square))\n;; first element\n\n(car ((cdr (square))))\n;; second element\n</code></pre> <p>Thus we can get new elements from the list.</p> <p>Note: This is the exact same way in which Alonzo Church defines Church Numerals. </p>","tags":["cs","learning","f","t"]},{"location":"programming-languages-part-b/#Datatype-with-structs","title":"Datatype with structs.","text":"<p>SML has records and datatype bindings that allows us to make compound dataypes and data-structures and it lets us use pattern matching to get the desired data out form the data structure.</p> <p>For Example,</p> <pre><code>val record_test =  { first = \"sohom\", second = \"b\", number = 1000 };\n(* creates a new record in the env and binds it to record_test *)\n\nval { first = t : string , second = tt : string, number = ttt : int } = record_test;\n\n(* This pattern matches the record on the left with the record on\nthe right and binds the values after extracting them from the\nrecord *)\n</code></pre> <p>We could implement the same kind of the thing in Racket using cons cells but there is an even better way in Racket. In Racket we can use structs to define custom data types.</p> <p>When we add a new datatype with <code>struct</code> it introduces a bunch of other functions into the environment. Let me illustrate this with an example.</p> <pre><code>(struct foo (field1 field2 field3))\n</code></pre> <p>This will introduce a constructor for this struct, a checker for this struct and accessor functions for each field in the struct. This is super handy.</p> <p>So we can do things like</p> <pre><code>(define new_t (foo 1 2 3))\n\n(foo? new_t)\n;; evaluates to #t\n\n(foo-field1 new_t)\n;; evaluates to 1\n\n(foo-field2 new_t)\n;; evaluates to 2\n\n(foo-field3 new_t)\n;; evaluates to 3\n</code></pre> <p>I think this is really cool. Especially because the user does not have to write accessor functions for all the types they define, but instead the language system generates them.

That was quite powerful, until I discovered Slavoj Zizek and a bunch of other philosophers (can not recall then but the Hellinistic age was rad), and its amazing to see how they can think through an issue or a problem.</p> <p>One major thing that all these people have in common and all of them advocate for is to read a lot, or in other words to study as much as possible. The world is increasingly complex with a lot of interrelated connections and you can only begin to make sense of it by trying to understand how these relationships unfold. What I am presonally impressedd by is that after a certain amount of time you begin to see things you could not see before, like hidden patterns that show you how the world works. Listening to people like Bill Gates, Harari, Peterson (to some extent), Zizek etc etc gives you a feeling of that.</p> <p>I recently came across Hellinistic Skepticism and one of the major take aways from learning about Hellinistic Skepticism is that they believed that truth is not binary and it was impossible to attain it and they valued knowing both sides of an argument very well.</p> <p>I read somewhere that </p> <p>You don't know something unless you can argue both for and against it; cause otherwise your opinions are not well informed.</p> <p>This was a major learning moment for me personally.

This is because ext4 has a lazyinit feature which allows for faster creation of the filesystem by not initializing all the inode tables at the start (i.e. during mkfs). Instead it defers the initialization to a background process when the filesystem is mounted and uses roughly 10% of the available bandwidth.

Infact they were a lot lower than the disk speed I was getting from a pure <code>rsync</code> workload. During one such run, I happened to look at the netdata dashboard and discovered that the operations/s was much lower for the rsync workload than the fio workload, even though rsync had a much larger throughput. This gave me the idea that we can in-fact change the bs to get much better results.</p> <p> Here in this photo we can clearly see the difference that block_size causes. The first write is done using a higher block_size which explains the lower operations per second along with the higher throughput; similarly the second write has lower throughput along with higher operations per second.

Fortunately, they were not too picky about it and were very understanding. In the technical interview also, they didnt make me write any program. I was asked to solve a problem by designing an algorithm and then optimize it to fit a certain time-complexity. I found this task slightly difficult as the last time I looked at Algorithms and Optimizations was in late 2018. I was surprized that I even remembered time-complexity. I did not expect this type of interview, however it was extremely fun. I enjoyed the intellectual challenge.</p> <p>I could not prepare heavily for the interview because the time frame in which this happened was too short. All the interviews were scheduled and completed in about 3 weeks. My friend told me that they wanted to fill the position really fast so I guess that had a part to play in it.

After almost 2 years of living at home this feels like the right call. The idea of moving to a new city began to scare me, at which point I knew that I had to move in order to preserve my sanity. The initial move was uneventful, but after getting an apartment, the real shit hits you in the face. It does take some calibration to get used to.</p> <p>Generally when you are moving to a new city, you do not have any place to stay for the initial part. My office took care of this. They put me up in a fancy hotel which helped me immensely.</p> <p>Apart from this, I did some initial research (with the help of a bunch of friends) as to where to look for a house/flat to rent. This time around I can actually afford to spend money on a private flat/house to rent that I do not have to share with other people. My salary has more or less doubled since my Mumbai days and the rents are quite cheaper than Mumbai. Living alone is a bit isolating, which is again something that I need to get used to.</p> <p>I found a nice apartment that a colleague was renting out. This was the most lucky event in the whole thing. The apartment is nice. It is very close proximity to a hill and a trail nearby which makes for a very easy weekend getaway.</p> <p>The public infrastructure in the city is quite interesting. Roads etc are nice, but public transit is very ineffective. Buses are late and very infrequent; though not unuseable. I've been commuting to work via buses for about 1 week now. It does work. The other mode of transport is basically auto-rickshaws which are quite expensive. For example, the route from my home to office costs 100 INR for 6/7 kms, while the same thing costs 15 INR in a bus.</p> <p>The people here speak a lot of Marathi, even more than Mumabi. I am planning to pick up the language. Almost all public signage is in Marathi. Being able to read Devnagari is a real blessing here. I can comfortably get around the city by reading the signage.</p> <p>The city is quite bicycle friendly. Most people who ride two-wheelers here do not wear safety equipment. The lack of helmets etc really worries me. I tried bicycling to work one day, which was fun; but also tiring. Pune isnt a flat city and the the route(s) to my workplace involve some rather significant climbing. Im sure not cycling for 2 years also affects this.</p> <p>Another thing that you can notice very easily is the rampant use of green-energy. The buses run on CNG, electric vehicles etc are abundant. It is really encouraging to see all of these steps being taken at a city-level.</p> <p>Office colleagues have been awesome. This is my first time in working in an organization this big. Lots of interesting things to look forward to.</p> <p>The weather here is interesting at best. Mornings and evenings are cool, and the afternoon is very hot. The temparature difference between the high and the low is almost 15C which is a lot in my opinion. As usual, this much delta in the temp makes cycling real interesting.</p> <p>This is my impression after being here for less than a month.

My face was slammed with the airbags. This smashed my glasses against my face. My eyes hurt for about 2 days after the accident.  I have no recollection of the airbag hitting my face. All I remember is that my face hurt all over and there was a slight burn on my nose for a couple days. I think that was due to the explosive in the airbags.</p> <p>My shoulder and abdomen had serious seat-belt related injuries. Both of my arms were injured as they were on the steering when this happened.</p> <p>My neck was injured because of the whiplash.</p> <p>Fortunately, none of the injuries were serious enough to need emergency medical attention. The doctors at the hospital cleared us with basic first aid and some x-rays to rule our severe problems with the skeletal system.</p> <p>I was referred to a spine specialist because of the whiplash and an ophthalmologist for my eyes. There was a chance that the neck would put an end to my motorcycling for months if not more. However after some more x-rays at the spine specialist, I was cleared for any neck/spine related injuries. However, I could not move my neck for about 1 week after the event.</p> <p>At the ophthalmologist, they wanted to rule out retinal detachment because of the accident. I had some retina examinations done, which resulted in some rather fancy colour photographs of my retina.

A bike trip was the last thing on my list, mainly because I didnt not have a proper luggage setup and more importantly, I promised myself that I would not take the bike on any long distance trip if I had less than 1000kms on the odometer.

The only thing that changes with the motorcycle is how many kilometres do I cover on a single day. </p> <p>On a bicycle a respectable and more important sustainable mileage is about 100kms per day.  On a bike, for me, that number is close to 400kms. (though I have never done 400kms) on a single day. My personal best is 360kms which happened when I took the bike to Mumbai and back to Pune on a single day.</p> <p>This is roughly how the route looked.</p> <ul> <li>Pune -&gt; Ganpatipule (via mahabaleshwar, Chiplun and Jaigad (308 kms)</li> <li>Ganpatipule -&gt; Tarkali (170kms)</li> <li>Tarkali -&gt; Palolem (182 kms)</li> <li>Palolem -&gt; Belgavi (147kms)</li> <li>Belgavi -&gt; Pune (350kms)</li> </ul> <p>Here is a link to Google Maps.

I kept the daily mileage to less than 200 kms on most days. I wanted to save some time and energy to do other stuff. Most of the evenings were packed with other activities.</p> <p>Mahabaleshwar was added to the itinerary of day-1 just 1 day before leaving. My colleague told me about strawberry and cream (a desert that is very famous in mahabaleshwar) and I could not refuse. Moreover, it added only about 20 extra kilometers to the total distance for day-1. It was ok.</p> <p>A friend recommended a scuba diving school in Tarkali and I jumped on the opportunity and decided to give it a shot. This needed pre-booking and the owner also helped me find a decent place to stay. It was great!</p> <p>I was supposed to go to Gokarna, but I was not able to find a hostel in time, hence I booked the first hostel that I could find using google-maps as I scanned upwards from Gokarna. As luck would have it, an old friend from school was also staying at Palolem during the exact dates and we hung out after more than 5 years. </p> <p>Belgavi was also fun, I decided to attend Science Hack Day. That was the designed stop.</p> <p>Soon, the plan came together like a jigsaw puzzle. For my first multi-day bike trip, this wasn't too bad.</p> <p>I was scared though.

It is a very small town. My friends suggested that I didn't need to fix my stay beforehand and I could just roll into the town and find a place to stay. My paranoid ass did not let me do this. I instead found a cheap hotel for the night on MakeMyTrip. With the destination set, I had one thing less to worry about.</p> <p>At about 6am in the morning, I loaded up the bag, put on my jacket and started.  To go Mahabaleshwar, you take the Pune-Bangalore highway and then exit from the highway just before Satara. The highway was nice and boring. I always find highways to be extremely boring.</p> <p>Things became interesting once we got off the highway. We moved to a double-track road from a 6 lane protected highway. The speed reduced considerably. Soon the ghats began. This part of the trip was amazing. The rolling ghats of Mahabaleshwar was amazing.</p> <p>What really surprised me was the abundance of strawberry and strawberry related imagery. I saw shops, cars, houses etc decorated with pictures and models of strawberries. I also saw strawberries being sold on the road-side in bulk. Till this moment, i had seen strawberries being sold in boxes-of-6 at the local market. I however, co'uld not buy some because I was travelling.</p> <p>On arriving at the \"Mapro Garden\" I took a much needed break and had the \"Strawberry with Cream\". It was amazing. Probably one of the best strawberries I've ever had. I never knew that strawberries could be so sweet!!! I used the facilities and left this place soon enough. The other half of the trip was still remaining for the day.</p> <p> Here is a photo of the desert and coffee. (The coffee was bad)</p> <p>I left soon after, as it was getting late. What followed was some of the best ghat section I've ever come across. I stopped and took a LOT of pictures. This is where most of my time was spent.</p> <p> The photo does not do justice.</p> <p>During the dry season, you can see the layers of rocks on the Deccan plateau. It looks like a multi-layered cake.</p> <p> LOOK at those layerssss!!!!</p> <p>After exiting the ghats, I decided to head to Chiplun instead of Dapoli as planned as going to Dapoli would take some time and I did not want to ride in the dark. I was feeling quite tired already. After Chiplun, I took a left and kept going towards Guhagar, and then took a left towards Jaigad. These roads were very small and they followed the contour of the hill very closely. Riding in these roads was very engaging, requiring a lot of clutch and gear adjustments. I was enjoying this thoroughly.  The sea was very close. You could smell it. This particular smell would be constant companion for the rest of the trip.</p> <p>There were sections in which the road had to cross a river that was emptying into the Arabian sea. To do this, the road would descend steeply to the sea-level where we would find a small bridge. Once you cross that bridge, the road would rise again. This happened some \u2154 times throughout the entire trip. During these \"dips\" (as I like to call them), I passed through multiple small fishing villages. I have a photo of one such village during a low-tide. It looks rather interesting.</p> <p></p> <p>In Jaigad we had a Ferry ride. I was looking forward to this part of the trip very much. I arrived just in time. The ticket cost me about 100 rupees for both myself and the bike. I met three other people on their motorcycles too. They were going to Goa as well. However, they were too experienced and too fast for me. So I decided not to follow them.</p> <p> This group was fun. We chatted a bit. That is my shadow taking the pic.</p> <p>On the other side of the ferry, things became very very interesting. Now, the road didn't climb onto the hill, instead it continued lazily along the sea. This geographic feature led to some amazing views. There was a point, where the hill on the left and the sea on the right were separated only by the road.  Like you could walk from the sea onto the hill in less than a kilometre. This blew me away. I stopped the bike and kept looking at this for some time. It was lovely.</p> <p> What did I tell you :-) ?</p> <p>The lodge was decent-enough. You can not and should not expect anything better at this price point. All I needed was a place to keep the bike and a place to sleep and shower. Fortunately the owners were quite cool about the bike. They had a decent parking facility. They were also kind enough to provide me with some hot water for the next day's early morning coffee. After checking-in I went to the beach and spent a couple hours there. </p> <p>Being a temple-town, there is a lot of \"pure-vegetarian\" food places. However being a coastal town, fish is a major part of thir diet. It was interesting to observe this dynamic. Most restaurants had 2 versions of itself, often seperated by a floor or some walls etc. One part would be completely vegetarian and the other part was completely non-veg. I had a fish-thali here. It was fresh and expensive and delicious.</p> <p></p> <p>That day I retired early and went to bed. The next day I started at around 8 am. The distance was less, but I also had a serious deadline. I had to reach the scuba place before 1 p.m. if I wanted to experience the larger tour.</p>","tags":["motorcycle","travel"]},{"location":"konkan-bike-tour-2022/#Day-2-Ganpatipule-to-Tarkali--Dec-21-2022-","title":"Day 2: Ganpatipule to Tarkali [ Dec 21, 2022 ]","text":"<p>The ride was very easy this day. We drove through some narrow roads and passed a lot of bridges and fishing villages. We reached Tarkali in about 5 hours and checked-in to the stay.</p> <p>The stay was at this lovely establishment run by this person since 2002. We spent some time chatting. He said he started with a single room to rent out and then slowly grew the property to about 14 rooms in the span of 18 years. He was strictly against loans from banks and instead relied on savings to fund his growth; he boasted that this is how he survived through covid, where tourism was at an all-time-low. He proudly  mentioned that his wife was his main support during these years and that without her support, he would not have been able to expand his business. The boasted that he was planning to build a swimming pool next. I was the only visitor to this property during this time, so we had a lot of time to chat.</p> <p>The property was adjacent to his house in-fact they shared the same compound and kitchen. The visitors were treated to the same food that the family prepared for themselves. So when he asked if I wanted to have dinner that night, I did not refuse.</p> <p> This is just a part of the whole stay. There are room adjacent to the building in the photo.</p> <p>After checking-in, I cleaned up a bit and went to the scuba thing. Since I had a decent amount of time before sundown, I decided that I wanted to have the longest possible tour.</p> <p>The setup was such; we were given wet-suits and put on a boat. The boat would then take us to a spot where we would do some basic training. After that we would do a couple dives in different parts of the sea.</p> <p>We started with some snorkelling exercises so that we can familiarise ourselves with the mechanics of breathing with a mask on. It took some time to get used to this, but afterwards, it was very easy. After this, we were given a very short training of some hand-signals and how to use the breathing apparatus underwater. Everything was supervised as the instructor would always be there with you.</p> <p>We did a couple of dives near the Sindhudurg fort. The corals that we saw were all dead.  What surprised me was that the entire activity was purely focused on photography. The instructors had an underwater camera and food for the fishes. They would prepare a shot and then use the food to bait the fish into the frame. This is how most of the pictures with the fishes were taken. There was a couple with me on the boat and they even had a couple's photo-shoot package. They made the couple pose cutely underwater and took photos and videos of it. This lasted for about 3 hours where we went to different parts of the sea using the boat and spent anywhere from 30 mins to 45 mins underwater. </p> <p>After all this was over, the photographs were promptly transferred to our mobile phones using a USB pen-drive. After this, we were dropped back on the sea beach and we could do whatever we wanted to do.</p> <p>I spent some more time walking on the beach and picking up dead blowfish that the sea bestowed upon the shore.</p> <p> There were a LOT of dead fishes. Not sure why.</p> <p>Slowly, I watched the setting sun against the backdrop of the Sindhudurg fort. It was magical. I waited a while longer for darkness to settle in. </p> <p></p> <p>Back at the stay I was treated to the best Konkan thali I've ever tasted. The food was tasty and delicious. They also gave me one extra Bangda (Indian Mackerel) and he would not accept payment for it. The solkadhi I had was also amazing. Apparently his wife's family had a secret recipe passed down the generations for this solkadhi.</p> <p> That white thing in the small bowl is the Solkadhi. It is not as red in color, but It was supremely flavorful.</p> <p>After diner I spent some time cleaning and lubing the bike chain.

Most parts of this leg of the journey has very very isolated sections of road and unlike the other parts of the journey, the roads were is very bad shape.

The road at this stretch was almost non-existent and broken, it wasn't dirt, it was just loose rocks. The bike was running in 2<sup>nd</sup> gear throughout. </p> <p>After this section, I did pass through some bridges overlooking some beautiful fishing villages. Some photos</p> <p> This was taken from a bridge.

I don't remember exactly where, but I got onto NH-66 somewhere between here and reaching Palolem. NH-66 was boring, but it was quite a bit of relief. The road conditions were so bad that I did not stop to take photos. After getting on the highway, there was no spot to take photos from. Almost all highways are the same concrete jungles.</p> <p>Riding in Goa was fun. The roads were beautiful and so was the city. Most of the roads were covered with large trees which was a great sight.</p> <p>Upon reaching Palolem, I had my first small mishap on this trip. I was reversing the bike and ended up putting the rear wheel into a ditch. One thing led to another and I found a metal part of the bike stuck onto my left calf. Through it didnt injure me too much, it did draw blood. I cleaned the wound after a couple local helped me get the bike out of the ditch. Fortunately the hostel and my stay for the next two days was just nearby. I parked the bike and cleaned up. </p> <p>I had originally planned to stay for 1 night in Goa, but extended it because me and the friend made some plans for the next day. We spent the entire day drinking and hanging out. We also spent a lot of time just sitting on the beach. This was very different from what I am used to. Initially the idle-ness of it made me very uneasy. I have to keep doing something. However, I got used to it quite soon and relaxing felt nice. This is of-course very different from my usual travelling where I fill every minute with something to do (even walking). We just sat there and witness the setting sun.

Anyway.</p> <p>With the help of a couple of these folks, I managed to pick up the bike and start it. Fortunately it started up. I was back in action.</p> <p>I drank a lot of water and washed my face with some of it. Then some of the locals urged me to take the bike to a garage and get the bike checked out. I complied. The mechanic at the garage told me that the bike was OK and in perfect drive-able condition. So, I decided that the best course of action for me was to head to the largest town nearby (which was Kolhapur) and to stay there for a day and to get myself checked out at a doctors.</p> <p>Kolhapur was 60kms in the other direction. So off I went. Halfway on my way to Kolhapur I realised that I didn't know where the accident occurred and more importantly, i did not have pictures of the accident site. So i stopped the bike and took some pics.

This is a place called Yuksom. Yuksom used to be the first capital of Sikkim. The ride from HMI to Yuksom was easy. We were given motion sickness tablets which really helped. The roads were okay for the most part, though some sections in the middle were absolutely terrible. It was a pleasant ride overall.</p> <p>Our car was the last one to arrive and by then other teams had already started pitching their tents. We followed suit and soon, we had a 6 person tent for ourselves. Pitching the tent was a challenge because none of the tents had any pegs. We ended up pulling stones from random places and typing the guy-lines to these stones. Things were really stable once we were done.</p> <p></p> <p>After lunch we went for a short walk to a local shrine called Norbugang Chorten. It is said that the first monarch of Sikkim was crowned here. The name Yuksom comes from this event too. Yuksom literally means meeting place of the three learned monks. These monks came together and selected Phuntsog Namgyal as the first Chogyal (or Religious King) of Sikkim.</p> <p>There was a shop near our camp grounds which was serving fancy-food; i.e. things like momos and packed goods. Some of us picked up rations for the climb. I didn't bother. I wanted this experience to be as raw as possible. I mean I will get to be a BM trainee at HMI for the first time only once; no point in diluting the experience (yeah!, I romanticize random things like this :P ).</p> <p>We were given a kilo to dry-fruits and sweets.

We clocked in a respectable 16 km and gained about 1200 m in elevation.  The trail was actually very prominent and we did not have any trouble finding our way. This trail is a very common hiking route which leads to the famous Goecha-La trek. The route till Dzongri is the same; after which we go into the Rathong Valley.</p> <p>We had hot breakfast at the camp and we carried dry food for our lunch. Today we would be crossing four bridges on our way and we were told in no uncertain terms that there is a very steep incline just after the fourth bridge and that the fourth bridge would be the last rest point for us. This is where we would stop to have lunch. </p> <p>As today was the first hike of the course, we soon figured out the dynamics. The entire batch soon split into groups. There was a forward party which comprised of the fastest and the strongest trekkers. They would cover some distance and then stop and wait for the rest of the team to catch up The instructors tried to make sure that the gap between the first group and the last group wasn't too large, but we soon discovered that the last group was so far behind that it made no sense to keep the entire batch waiting. Often this gap was about 2 hours. </p> <p>I was very worried about my knee. I even started using my trekking-poles. However I found that my knees behaved admirably and I was able to complete the trek with the first group itself. I was very proud of myself. </p> <p>The camp at Tshoka was a mixed camp. Some of us were allotted rooms in the wooden house while some were allotted camping spots and they had to pitch tents. </p> <p>Surprisingly, we had slightly unstable mobile network at this campsite. The weather was cloudy and it started raining too. I was worried. </p> <p>After this, we headed for a short acclimatization walk. There was noting short about this. We walked for about 3 km. As it was raining, we wore the rain-gear. I also made the mistake of wearing my feather-jacket underneath the rain gear. This was a major mistake as I would soon discover. </p> <p>The weather was cold and it was raining, but hiking in the feather jacket would mean that I was extremely sweaty. Thus the entire feather jacket was wet by the time we reached the end of the acclimatization walk. This was a fairly flat place on the trail. We had a class on the local flora and fauna that this point. The rain had stopped by this time and we were glad to be able to take off our rain-gear. This was a relief and it allowed for much needed ventilation.</p> <p>We stayed the night at Tshoka. Some of us went to the only cafe here and we treated ourselves to a hot bowl of Wai-Wai (a variety of instant noodles that is very common here).</p> <p>The next day we had more classes and stuff. Nothing spectacularly interesting about this day. </p> <p>Here is a photo looking up towards the cafe at Tshoka.</p> <p></p> <p>We were due to leave to Dzongri the next day. The rest of the day is a bit hazy. All I know is that it was raining and it was cold. </p> <p>At this point I was ok. I was not sick.

The trail climbs as soon as we start. In some places the trail is paved with wooden logs. We find snow on the trail almost immediately. We were expecting snow and this was indeed fun.  We were walking through a forest at this point. It was quite dense and the Rhododendrons were blooming. The trail is quite steep until we reach Phedang. Here is a wooden hut and sometimes we can get tea/momos here. </p> <p>We find ourselves above the tree line at the point. The big trees that were towering over us gradually started reducing in their height. By the time we reach Dhongri they were barely 1 feet taller than us. After Phedang the trail eases out and we find ourselves traversing across the mountain. After the final turn we can see the Dzongri trekkers hut from a distance. It is a welcome sight. </p> <p>Here is a photo from a different angle. </p> <p>At Dzongri we are again camping for 2 days. We proceed to pitch our tent. As usual, the pegs are missing, we decide to tie our tent with another tent. Space was limited and so were big stones; hence this was the best thing to do here. Dzongri was very cold. To our dismay, we discovered that the tent had a damaged zipper which meant that one side of the tent would be open throughout the night. We strategically places our bags and gear along this side to guard against wind.</p> <p>After lunch we walked up to Dzongri Top  for our acclimatization climb. The entire route took us about 3 hours and we spent sometime at the top. I did not record this route, but from memory I think it was this route</p> <p>I remember the route being not so steep and a lot of contouring across the hills. Anyway the specifics do not really matter I guess.</p> <p>After this we descended down and had the rest of the day free. A bunch of us settled in the house of a couple who live there and run a small shop. The shop has everything, from chocolates to woolen socks. Everything is marked up here due to the logistical challenges. We also found delicious momos here and a room with a Bukhari which was a hit amongst the trainees. I found myself blowing into the Bukhari using a metal rod to kindle the fire. This was my first time doing this, so I was guided by a friend. It was an incredible experience, to watch the fire turn wood into dust. </p> <p>The night was interesting. It started snowing soon after dinner and it didn't stop for a while. It was very windy and snowy. We woke up the middle of the night with the entire tent shaking because of the wind. The tent was not properly pitched and we worried that it would collapse. Thankfully, the night passed without any incident. The next morning we were surprised by the condition of our tents. Almost every tent was in bad shape. It had snowed significantly during the night and that caused the tents to sag a LOT. We tried our very best to clear the snow and it worked for a while.  The lack of pegs meant that every tent was attached to rocks and some of these attachments were not too strong, which made things worse.</p> <p></p> <p>Today we were going for a walk to Lakshmi Pokhri. Again I did not record this, but based on photographs and memory this is the route. Honestly, I have no idea if this is Laxmi Pokhri or not as OSM says different things. If this lake is indeed Laxmi Pokhri, then we must update the maps. I will wait for more confirmation before I do that. Anyway, we must move on. The hike to the lake was fun, there was enough snow, mist and wind to make the hike very interesting. After we reached the lake, we walked around the lake once as a ritual. After that the entire batch got together to click a picture.

When we went to recover the tents, we discovered that the aluminum poles had frozen and were jammed with each other. This made it impossible to take apart the tent or to pitch them properly. We requested the instructors to let us sleep in the wooden shelter. It was already occupied by 6 instructors, so fitting an extra 12 people would be slightly hard. But they agreed and soon all of us took part is transporting our gear from the tents to the hut in the middle of heavy snowfall. Once we were done, we tried to take apart the tents and packed them up. Some of tent-poles were left as it is because we could not dismantle them due to the cold weather.

We both agreed that I would not want to return to civilization after the course. Moreover, I was already planning some solo hikes to complete after the course was over.

Since Manaslu Circuit falls in the Manaslu Circuit Restricted Area, we have to have a guide with us. This made things slightly more expensive, but overall the costs are still lower as we are sharing the fixed costs between the 6 of us.

We made minor changes to the trail which I shall write about once I get back from the trail.</p> <p>I was very adamant that I would NOT buy the return tickets from Nepal.
