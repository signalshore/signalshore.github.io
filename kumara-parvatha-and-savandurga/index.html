<p>In the second week of January I had a trip planned to Bangalore. The<br />
main goal here was to figure out some work in Bangalore and college. </p>
<p>However during the Sandakphu trek some of the trekkers there<br />
convinced me that Western Ghats is amazing and that I should<br />
absolutely trek the Kumarparvatha thing. Its long, its challenging,<br />
its fun. </p>
<p>I had another trek planned with some of my Bangalore friends. So, I<br />
had to figure out how to squeeze these two treks in a single weekend as<br />
I was traveling during the middle of the week for cheaper tickets. On<br />
top of this Richard Stallman came to India during that weekend (I got<br />
super lucky tbh) and I could attend his talk in person.</p>
<h1 id="The-Plan">The Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#The-Plan" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Everyone said that Kumaraparvatha is a two day trek. Now I did not<br />
have 2 days to spare. I had to fit 2 treks in the weekend. </p>
<p>I had divided the weekend into two parts; Part 1, the trek to<br />
Kumaraparvatha and Part 2, the trek to Savandurga. My plan <em>was</em><br />
flawless. The plan was to work from home on Friday and take an<br />
overnight bus to Kukke-Subramanya and start the trek, trek for the day<br />
and return to Kukke by Saturday eveing just in time to board a bus to<br />
Bangalore. Reach Bangalore early morning and then head off to meet<br />
the other group for the Savandurga trek. Then finish the Savandurga<br />
trek by 1800 hrs and get back home.</p>
<p>Things clearly did not go as planned. They never do.</p>
<h1 id="So-Kumaraparvatha-">So.. Kumaraparvatha ..<a class="headerlink" href="#So-Kumaraparvatha-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Friday turned out to be the day when Richard Stallman was giving the<br />
talk at RVCE. I HAD to attend it. So, did that; which got over at<br />
15:00 hrs. The bus was at 20:00. I had 7 hours. I needed to finish<br />
some work as well. Went to a friends house and left some of my stuff<br />
(the laptop) there. I had assumed that I would leave for the trek well<br />
rested, but by the time I was in the bus, i was carrying 7 hours of<br />
extra sweat.</p>
<p>All said and done I met with Sonakshi and Niranjan at Majestic at the<br />
stipulated time . We had 2 idlis for dinner. I was under the<br />
impression that I would be able to get bananas from Kukke-Subramanya but<br />
I was mistaken. In the morning none of the shops would be open. So, the<br />
others made me buy the wonder fruit. We also got a bunch of peanut<br />
brittles.</p>
<p>The bus started on time, but it reached Kukke-Subramanya at 0430 hrs in<br />
the morning. This was almost an hour before my schedule. We decided<br />
not to waste too much time and hit the trail right away. </p>
<p>It was pitch dark and my head lamp was not working. We figured out a<br />
way to make it work with me walking in the middle of the group and<br />
using the torch on my powerbank. I did not want to use my phone as a<br />
torch because I was recording the entire trek in OSMAND with<br />
continuous logging.</p>
<p>We reached Buttaramane soon enough. We stopped there for some time for<br />
food and the loo. We also filled our water bottles. I had to brush my<br />
teeth due to peer pressure. We had some lemon rice and got three<br />
plates packed to carry with us. The forest office was nearby from here.</p>
<p>At the forest office we had to pay for entry and had to get our bags<br />
inspected We could also leave some stuff at the forest office so as to<br />
reduce the load that we would be carrying. I didn't leave anything<br />
behind. I was kinda-sorta training for the next trek.</p>
<p>The trek was amazing. It is a pretty trek. We were not trekking for<br />
the view anyway. The thing I like about Kumaraparvatha is the<br />
challenge. It is a long trek. 12kms in one direction. Generally<br />
people hike up to the forest office in a day and use the next day to<br />
trek up-to the peak and back. The forest officials do not allow anyone<br />
into the forest after 12 noon. Its almost 6 kms to the peak from the<br />
forest office, and also more technical, so if you do not start from<br />
the forest office before 12 noon, it can get dangerous.</p>

<img alt="One of the flatter stretches" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/kum2.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the way to the top there is a section where you come across a steep<br />
rock-face which looked inviting. But Sonakshi and Niranjan being the<br />
saner members of the group stopped me from climbing via that route. I<br />
was disappointed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Big rock face is question. (it is Not as steep as it looks)<br />
<img alt="big rock" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/kum3.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We reached the top in about 6 hours. We slept for a very very short<br />
time and had the packed food before starting back. By this time it was<br />
afternoon and the sun was over our heads. We did not have too much<br />
water with us as well.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is the other side from the same location<br />
<img alt="big rock" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/kum4.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part of the descent was somewhat difficult because of the<br />
heat, and we ran out of water just before reaching Buttaramane but<br />
nothing too much. I got disoriented a bit and kept slippin. A banana<br />
fixed it. We waited at the forest office for some time and then headed<br />
to Buttaramane. We refilled our bottles here and started off<br />
again. From then the journey was fun. We kept descending at a faster<br />
pace, we were almost running downhill. We took a detour went to a<br />
stream nearby. Dipping our feet in the stream felt amazing. We waited<br />
for about half an hour here before leaving.</p>
<p>We exited the forest at about 1800 hours. Our bus was at 22:30 hrs, so<br />
we had a bunch of hours to kill. We jumped around for a bit<br />
legitimately impressed by our pace. The experienced folks told me that<br />
our pace was impressive. I trusted them.</p>
<p>We had some food, sat on the road, and got kicked out of a restaurant.<br />
Then we boarded the bus and slept.</p>
<p>We reached Bangalore quite early. I was trying to convince Sonakshi<br />
and Niranjan to come to the Savandurga trek with me but I was not<br />
successful. Niranjan said he would come. Then Sonakshi went her way,<br />
while me and Niranjan headed to his place. We were planning to freshen up<br />
(no showering) and then head to the meetup location for Savandurga. In<br />
the end Niranjan also ditched me. I removed the base layer I was<br />
wearing. That improved the smell a tiny bit.  I left Niranjans place<br />
and then had a friend pick me up on the rental car that we booked for<br />
Savandurga. I got lucky logistically.</p>
<p>Let's end this section with a picture of team Kumaraparvatha. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>TEAM Kumaraparvatha!!<br />

<h1 id="Part-2--Savandurga">Part 2 .. Savandurga..<a class="headerlink" href="#Part-2--Savandurga" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>My friend and I met with the rest of the group at 10:00 hrs which was<br />
1 hours later than our plan. Anyway, we said our hellos and started.<br />
The drive wasn't that bad. We stopped on the middle for some food and<br />
stuff to pack.</p>
<p>The road to Savandurga (via Magdi Road) is just beautiful. This was a<br />
familiar route since I had cycled through the same road about a year<br />
back. We could see the hill as we started to approach it. Some of the<br />
team members expressed their concerns over the difficulty of what<br />
awaited them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how Savndurga looks from the road.<br />
<img alt="savnd" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/savn3.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We reached Savandurga in about 90 minutes.The team was quite worried<br />
when we saw the monolith. We were making good time, however we<br />
wasted a decent amount of time eating stuff before we started<br />
trekking. </p>
<p>The thing that makes Savandurga challenging is the gradient and the<br />
feature. It's steep. It's a short but a very steep climb. It's also<br />
just a rock. You are climbing on a rock. Which means that it heats up<br />
really fast and finding traction is quite difficult. On top of that<br />
there are not many trees on the rock, so shade is really hard to find<br />
as well. Finding a place to sit is also a challenge since once you are<br />
on the rock, there is a constant gradient. You are always tilted<br />
somewhere, so even if you decide to sit down, you have to make sure<br />
you do not slide down. Considering all this I really wanted to avoid<br />
the afternoon sun, but by the time we started it was almost 12 when we<br />
started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the gradient.<br />
<img alt="savnd-grad" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/savn1.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A friend got really exhausted during the climb and she decided that<br />
she would not continue. The plan was that she would wait at a resting<br />
spot and we would pick her up on the way down. </p>
<p>As we continued up, a lot of the kids wanted to give up but they kept<br />
at it. There is a place on top of Savandurga which is just blow the<br />
peak (we will call this the 'spot').  The entire group decided to call<br />
it a day there and not continue till the peak itself, except Rohit and<br />
Nikhil and I. The three of us were quite pumped about the idea and<br />
decided to sprint to the top and come back ASAP.</p>
<p>In my honest opinion the trek to the top from the spot is the most<br />
trickiest part since it has some of the more challenging<br />
terrain. Until now we were trekking on the rock itself, but the<br />
monolith plateaus at the spot and after that there is a section where<br />
you walk between huge boulders, a section where you have to squeeze<br />
between two boulders and a section just before the peak where you have<br />
to climb a very steep boulder. It's not too tough, just challenging. </p>
<p>The top of Savandurga is where the temple is. The view from the top is<br />
just amazing. You can see the Manchanabele reservoir nearby and an all<br />
round view from the top of the largest monolith. We took a bunch of<br />
pics here.</p>
<blockquote>

<img alt="savnd-temple" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/savn2.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On our way back we met the friend who decided to stay back just below<br />
the spot. She started feeling better so she decided to trek to the top<br />
herself. It was super awesome to see her so unexpectedly. She also had<br />
some food with her, which was very much needed. Needless to say, all<br />
of us were very much impressed by her. </p>
<p>Descending was fun. I did something that I have always wanted to<br />
do. Run down the hill. Do not do this unless you know what you are<br />
doing. Its very very very dangerous to run down a hill which is as<br />
steep as Savandurga. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how descending looks. <br />
<img alt="savnd-desc" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/savn4.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had a mini celebration after descending from the hill. It was<br />
fun. These folks had completed their very first trek. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the team.<br />
<img alt="savnd-team" src="../assets/images/2019-03-17/team_savn.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We returned to Bangalore soon enough. I took an hour long nap for the<br />
major part of the journey back home. The others I believe took some<br />
embarrassing photos of me sleeping.</p>
<h1 id="GPX-tracks-and-Analysis">GPX tracks and Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#GPX-tracks-and-Analysis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I was recording both of these treks just for the heck of it. <br />
Here are screenshots.</p>

<p>As we can see, the total time for the recording is 11 hours and 25<br />
minutes and the total distance recorded is 23.7<br />
kms. <a href="../assets/files/2019-03-17/KumaraParvatha.gpx.zip">Here</a> is the<br />

<p>In this trek we covered 5.9 kms in about 4 hours and 9 minutes.<br />

<h1 id="The-End">The End<a class="headerlink" href="#The-End" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Overall this was a fun trek. I do think I will return to<br />
Kumaraparvatha once again after monsoon. This is the time when the<br />
Western Ghats is in its full glory. :-)</p>
<p>Until then!</p>
<p>Oh! BTW;</p>
